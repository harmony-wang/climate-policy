      "borhood. When Angelenos experience homelessness, trying to find the location of services without access to technology and resources can be challenging—especially in a new neighborhood. However, if the services are coordinated, then the myriad systems that can assist Angelenos experiencing homelessness can be better integrated. Scaling up the CES is one of the major initiatives in the City’s homelessness strategy, which includes more than 62 recommendations to address homeless- ness over the next 10 years. Through the implementation of the No Wrong Door approach to City services, Angelenos without homes can access resources in any neighborhood, from any agency. The City is equipping departments with tools and information to help them assist individuals in accessing housing services. These tools and the CES expansion will include the integration of outreach teams, enhanced data sharing and tracking, and specialized services for the most vulnerable Angelenos. The expansion of emergency shelters into 24-hour operations with co-location of local CES providers is also being pursued. SHOCKS/STRESSES TIMEFRAME Medium Term PARTNERS LAHSA / RAP / DPW / HCID / LAFD / LAPD / Homeless services agencies / City departments CITY OF IMMIGRANTS Los Angeles celebrates its diversity. Angelenos hail from more than 150 countries and speak over 200 languages. More than 40% of Angelenos were born in a foreign country, and 66% are either immigrants or the children of immigrants. Of the nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants who live in California, slightly over 1 million reside in Los Angeles County and most have lived here for an average of 10 years.36 Immigrants contribute to and improve the economy, making up 32% of California’s GDP. Yet, California households headed by immigrants have a per capita income one-quarter below average, and households headed by undocumented immigrants make close to $12,000 less annually, leaving them partic- ularly at risk for exploitation and abuse.37 While immigrants are a vibrant part of society in Los Angeles, foreign-born Angelenos also present a challenge when it comes to emergency preparedness and integration. Linguistic barriers, coupled with incomes which may be below the poverty level and heightened fears stemming from recent immigration- enforcement actions, leave our immigrant population more isolated. Immigrants are also more likely to stay within their communities and lack trust in government. All of these factors place a stress not only on the immigrant population residing in Los Angeles, but also on their family members and the population of Los Angeles as a whole. CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND EXPAND THE LOS ANGELES JUSTICE FUND The City will strengthen its partnership with the Los Angeles Justice Fund to provide critical assistance to Los Angeles’ immigrant populations. 29 In Los Angeles County, more than two- thirds of people appearing in immigration court face a judge and federal prosecutor without legal representation. The Los Angeles Justice Fund is a multi-million public-private partnership that aims to promote due process and justice by increasing access to legal representation and counsel for individuals and families dealing with immigration court removal proceedings. A partnership between the City of Los Angeles, L.A. County, the California Community Foundation, and the Weingart Foundation, the Los Angeles Justice Fund provides funding to nonprofit legal service organizations currently engaged in immigration court cases and who represent populations in detention centers. The fund will serve vulnerable populations including victims of human trafficking and DACA recipients. Organization began to receive funding in the fall of 2017. The fund also supports pilot programs that seek to expand the pool of immigration attorneys available to provide representation. These efforts prioritize vulnerable populations, including women and children.

The City will work with the nonprofit Welcoming America and additional partners to document our best practices and establish additional strategies that address leadership, equitable access, civic engagement, connected communities, education, economic development, and safety through the certification process. Special attention will be paid to leverage existing and create new neighborhood- based programs that address our most vulnerable populations and increase community participation in the program development process.

In 2015, this approach was codified in the Los Angeles Framework, which addresses all forms of violent extremism. The City is focused on advancing community resilience through network-building, engagement, trust-building efforts, and community-driven preventative programs. This work is based on objectives pivotal to ensuring effective community engage- ment around social inclusion, including: • Developing a collective vision for community-driven impact. • Consolidating resources in an accessible online platform. • Creating a culturally appropriate service referral system. • Building capacity of community-based organizations by facilitating relationships. • Raising awareness and elevating civil society as a leading voice.

LAPL partnered with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to provide natural- ization information and civic engagement opportunities to support the City’s immi- grant population, regardless of status. The New Americans Centers function as a community go-to for services around citizenship, including eligibility screenings, naturalization workshops and green card renewals, Know Your Rights workshops, small business support, family prepared- ness workshops, family location services, and ESL conversation classes. Additional services around local civics instruction, inter-cultural communication, records locat- ing, business licensing, and mentoring are provided. This initiative reflects the LAPL’s continued efforts to welcome everyone and to provide a lifeline of support for isolated or marginalized populations by providing people with information and resources. Stronger and Connected Neighborhoods GOAL 6: PREPARE AND PROTECT THOSE MOST VULNERABLE TO INCREASING EXTREME HEAT DEVELOP AN URBAN HEAT VULNERABILITY INDEX AND MITIGATION PLAN TO PREPARE FOR HIGHER TEMPERATURES AND MORE FREQUENT EXTREME HEAT Develop a framework for prioritizing neighborhoods, engaging stakeholders, creating policies, identifying funding sources, and recommending budgets in support of changes that will lead to a heat-resilient Los Angeles. 32 The City will support and participate in community-led efforts to identify barriers and opportunities to accelerating extreme heat mitigation. TreePeople and Climate Resolve will bring their expertise in partnership-building and complex urban environmental problem-solving to co-facilitate the creation of a Los Angeles Urban Heat Island Mitigation Plan. The plan will include policy frameworks and directives; a neighborhood prioritization framework; engagement toolkits for communities, businesses, and other stakeholders; and other elements as they are identified. The plan will also engage with the public health community to incorporate a method for identifying populations most at risk of heat-related health problems and develop plans for outreach and intervention on high-heat days. The plan will be informed by stake- holder engagement, including from City departments and community members, and it will identify City policies that can be changed, augmented, or created to support heat mitigation. Concurrently, an advisory group will provide advice on engaging communities in adopting heat mitigation practices and behaviors.

The retrofit program will demonstrate cooling, public health improvements, and other benefits for residents. It will also feature education and engagement supporting community action and behavior changes. This will be achieved by engaging community members in creating retrofit designs that are neighborhood-appropriate and by offering educational how-to workshops to support simple strategies such as planting trees and employing naturally cooling materials on roofs and other surfaces. Through this pilot program, our partners will seek to introduce new climate and social science, decision-support tools, and tangible demonstrations that will accelerate Los Angeles’ transition to extreme heat resilience.

Densely populated cities in warm climates like Los Angeles’ often experience the urban heat island effect. A combination of dark pavement cover, clusters of buildings, traffic, and lack of trees creates high tem- perature hot spots known as heat islands. The Sustainable City pLAn set the target to curb this phenomenon by reducing urban heat by 1.7°F by 2025 and 3° by 2035. Key strategies to reach this goal include: • Requiring cool roofs for all new and refurbished homes. In 2013, Los Angeles was the first major city to enact this requirement. LADWP provides cool roof rebates to help Angelenos offset the cost. • Laying down cool pavement. Los Angeles is the first city to pilot cool pavements for on-road use. • Building up the city’s green infrastructure, such as trees for shading and cooling. Temperatures have been rising and breaking records in recent years. Notably, 2015 replaced 2014 as the hottest year on record in California.38 Climate scientists at UCLA project that this warming trend will continue and that the region will be at least 3° warmer between 2040 and 2060, even with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.39 By 2100, Los Angeles’ average annual temperature may increase as much as 8° degrees under a business-as-usual emissions scenario. Angelenos will also face more extreme heat days, which are days with temperatures over 95°. All Los Angeles communities are projected to experience additional extreme heat days each year; however, some neighborhoods will experience at least twice as many as they do today.40 The city’s urban landscape is covered with paved surfaces that absorb heat. This heat then reradiates and warms surrounding air, creating an urban heat island effect, which can add as much as 6–10° to the background temperature.41 The rising local temperatures and increase in the number of heat waves, as well as the increase in both the severity and the length associated with a single heat wave, also significantly impact public health. Hospital admissions spike on peak heat-wave days, with particular impacts for/nENHANCE, AND PROTECT THE LOS ANGELES RIVER WATERSHED’S ECOSYSTEM AND BIODIVERSITY 80 IDENTIFY STRATEGIES TO REDUCE POLLUTION IN THE LOS ANGELES RIVER SYSTEM 81 PROVIDE EDUCATION PROGRAMMING TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY WATERSHED AND KEEP ANGELENOS SAFE 82 LEVERAGE THE LARIVERWAY FOR EMERGENCY ACCESS AND EVACUATION ROUTES TO INCREASE CITYWIDE PREPAREDNESS AND DISASTER RESPONSE CAPACITY CHAPTER 4: PIONEERING AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNER Resilient Los Angeles Resilient Los Angeles Resilient Los Angeles Resilient Los Angeles Resilient Los Angeles Resilient Los Angeles Appendix B: Summary of Actions by Interest Area Appendix B: Summary of Actions by Interest Area 163 162 163 162 163 163 162 DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RECOVERY CHAP GOAL ACTION TIMEFRAME SHOCKS/STRESSES 1 2 EXPAND WORKFORCE PREPAREDNESS TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AND PROGRAMS TO QUICKLY RESTORE ESSENTIAL CITY SERVICES AFTER A MAJOR SHOCK 1 3 INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ANGELENOS WITH PREPAREDNESS RESOURCES AND TRAINING IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES 1 4 TEACH ANGELENOS HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM CYBERATTACKS 1 5 GROW PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND NONPROFIT SECTORS TO PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES TO VULNERABLE ANGELENOS IN TIMES OF CRISIS 1 6 INCREASE ACCESS TO EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND MITIGATION RESOURCES FOR BUSINESSES 1 7 PROVIDE ANGELENOS ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL TRAUMA RESOURCES 1 8 GROW PARTNERSHIPS THAT EXPAND SUPPORT FOR ANIMALS AFTER A MAJOR SHOCK 2 24 PROMOTE NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT ALL LOS ANGELES NEIGHBORHOODS IN DEVELOPING PREPAREDNESS PLANS 2 25 INCREASE NEIGHBORHOOD OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AROUND WILDFIRE AND MUDSLIDE RISK REDUCTION IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE NEIGHBORHOODS 2 35 EXPAND THE CITY’S NEIGHBORHOOD COOLING CENTER PROGRAM 3 46 INTEGRATE ADDITIONAL RESILIENCE MEASURES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LOS ANGELES RIVER WATERWAY REVITALIZATION EFFORTS 3 47 ADOPT EMERGENCY LAND-USE TOOLS TO ADDRESS DISPLACEMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT IN ADVANCE OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENT 3 51 FACILITATE PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOS ANGELES BUSINESSES THROUGH THE L.A.

To address these risks, build food security, and invest in the local food economy and system, the City will work closely with the LAFPC to explore partnership opportunities and support initiatives that meet the following objectives: • Expand food access and choices in communities that are food insecure. • Expand urban farms and community gardens, as these spaces contribute to local food production, urban greening and cooling, stormwater capture, and social cohesion. • Promote the local Good Food movement, championed by LAFPC, and consider using the City’s procurement and purchasing opportunities to support and grow the local food economy. • Encourage companies to reduce food waste and increase food access by partnering with local communities and nonprofits to donate excess food products. The City will also support local food businesses in developing resilience plans through the following actions: • Partner with researchers to further study food resilience in Los Angeles by developing case studies, identifying additional key distribution and retail vulnerabilities, and highlighting opportunities to build and sustain food resilience. • Provide training, educational resources, and technical assistance to neighborhood and corner stores and create plans to ensure continued operations during and after a disaster. • Encourage and prioritize resilient building improvements, from seismic retrofits to backup power, for food distribution suppliers in Los Angeles. • Identify opportunities to increase capacity for distribution points, such as food banks, schools, and hospitals, to serve larger numbers of people after a disaster.

This will allow the City to communicate quickly and directly to Angelenos through smartphones, desktops, and notification systems such as public address systems. Los Angeles has the highest concentration of earthquake early warning sensors in the country, making the City an ideal site for pilot programs and attracting state and federal partners that continue to invest in the West Coast system as a whole.

As a result, the city’s entire water supply is at risk in the event of an earthquake. Prompted by seismic-resilient pipe pilot programs at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), the City is pursuing an effort to develop standard specifications for water pipelines to ensure that they are able to withstand seismic-induced forces.

The fields are either active oil and gas producers, abandoned, or used for natural gas storage. There are more than 5,100 oil wells in the City that are active, idle, buried, orphaned, or abandoned. The fields and wells could create potential methane leak points or become sources of toxic air emissions, oil spills, or fire hazards. In addition, a large network of underground utility pipelines under the streets and sidewalks of Los Angeles carries crude oil, natural gas, diesel, jet fuel, water, steam, and electricity. In the event of a large-scale emergency, these pipelines could rupture and create additional leaks, spills, or subsidence— when land sinks or caves in—and become potential fuel for fires or chemical contaminants in waterways or storm drains. Los Angeles has approximately five refineries within city limits that are susceptible to fire hazards, explosions, toxic chemical releases, petroleum product spills into the stormwater system, and other threats in an extreme emergency or regional disaster. Regionally, there are four other large petroleum refineries, multiple marine oil terminals at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, offshore oil drilling islands, and utility pipeline networks adjacent to the City of Los Angeles. While this oil and gas infrastructure is outside city boundaries it could have a substantial impact to Los Angeles residents in the event of large-scale catastrophe.

This pioneering spirit can be traced to the City’s partnerships with research institutions, businesses, community leaders, and public agencies. In looking beyond our city boundaries, we constantly seek to leverage our investments, collaborate meaning- fully, and learn with and from others. In partnership with leading universities and labs—including world-class academics, scientists, and researchers—the City uses cutting-edge science and data to inform planning and decision-support processes. Given Los Angeles’ size and infrastructure, the City encourages and supports sustainable and resilient marketplaces to grow through purchasing power, broader citywide policies, and partnerships. Los Angeles boasts extraordinary diversity in its people, neighbor- hoods, and natural habitats. This diversity attracts both private and public partners to pioneer new pilots, technologies, and programs to meet challenges, reach for opportunities, and serve as a model for other cities around the world. As part of the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) Network, Los Angeles is collaborating with global resilience leaders and helping to set a course for the emerging resilience field. A resilient partner is nimble, resourceful and excited to bring others to the table.

The City of Los Angeles is committed to being a global leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures. The City is developing a roadmap for climate action planning consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement and has set targets to reduce emissions 45% below 1990 levels by 2025 and 80% by 2050. The reduction of emissions is essential in preventing additional climate impacts in Los Angeles and building climate resilience both locally and globally. The City will work with experts to develop a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to help inform which people, places, and systems will be impacted by climate change. To mitigate these hazards and protect residents, it is crucial to engage partners on building the knowledge, skills, and governance and finance structures for effective climate resilience planning. The City will also coordinate actions and policies with state-level leaders and other cities in the Southern California region to ensure we are building upon one another’s priorities and successes. SHOCKS/STRESSES TIMEFRAME Short Term PARTNERS 100RC / C40 / Climate Mayors / State of California / ARCCA / LARC / DCP / City departments TRANSITION TO ZERO-EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGY AT THE PORT OF L.A. TO REDUCE EMISSIONS, IMPROVE AIR QUALITY, AND BUILD DISASTER RESILIENCE Leverage clean air investments and energy innovation at the Port of L.A. to improve air quality, achieve significant emission reductions, and address energy vulnerabilities. 74 The Port of Los Angeles is an important national and economic asset. It is the entry point for 41% of cargo entering the West Coast and indirectly supports one in 13 jobs in Los Angeles.77 Although the Port of Los Angeles is an industry leader in air pollution reductions, it remains a regional source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. To address these emissions, San Pedro Bay Ports adopted ambitious new targets in an updated Clean Air Action Plan in November 2017. This plan outlines the ramp-up of near-zero and zero-emissions standards for trucks, in order to meet a goal of a 100% zero- emission truck fleet by 2035. The Port is investing in projects and partnerships that will both reduce emissions and increase on-site energy resilience through combined generation, storage, and backup capabilities. For example, in partnership with Pasha and the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the port launched the Green Omni Terminal Demonstration project in 2016. At full build out, the terminal will be the first in the world to generate all of its energy needs from renewables. It will utilize zero- or near zero-emission equipment, capture and treat ship exhaust, and feature its own solar microgrid, backed up by battery storage and an energy management system to allow the terminal to operate off the grid during system outages.78 SHOCKS/STRESSES TIMEFRAME Long Term PARTNERS POLA / POLB / LADWP / CARB / Maritime partners THE PORT OF L.A. LEADS IN AIR QUALITY ACTION In November 2017, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach unanimously approved the Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP) Update, setting the course for eliminating harmful air emissions from port-related sources. The 2017 CAAP builds off of the clean air achievements of the 2006 plan and set outs measures to reduce greenhouse gases from port- related sources to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. To reduce emissions, the ports will advance the Clean Trucks Program to phase out older trucks and transition to near-zero emissions in the early years and zero-emission trucks by 2035. The 2017 CAAP includes new strategies to plan for and develop the infrastructure necessary for near-zero and zero-emissions goods movement. The ports will require terminal operators to purchase zero- emissions equipment if feasible, or near-zero or cleanest available when procuring new equipment. These efforts will protect public health and improve air quality with targets to reduce the population-weighted residential cancer risk of Port-related DPM emissions by 85% by 2020 and to reduce port-related emissions by 59% for NOx, 93% for SOx, and 77% for DPM by 2023.79 Photo: Office of Mayor Garcetti Pioneering and Collaborative Partner Pioneering and Collaborative Partner Resilient Los Angeles Resilient Los Angeles GOAL 12: USE CLIMATE SCIENCE TO DEVELOP ADAPTATION STRATEGIES GOAL 12: USE CLIMATE SCIENCE TO DEVELOP ADAPTATION STRATEGIES 129 128 TRANSITION TO FOSSIL-FUEL-FREE STREETS TO FIGHT AIR POLLUTION AND HELP TACKLE THE GLOBAL THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE The City is committed to the C40 Fossil-Fuel-Free Streets Declaration to purchase only zero-emissions buses by 2025 and eliminate emissions in one major area by 2030. 75 In October 2017, Mayor Garcetti joined mayors from around the world in commit- ting to new policies that will make cities greener, healthier, and more prosperous by signing the C40 Fossil-Fuel-Free Streets Declaration. The City is committed to purchasing only zero-emission buses by 2025 and to eliminating emissions in a designated area by 2030. These policies build on Los Angeles’ leadership and efforts to implement zero emissions technology, including building one of the largest municipal electric vehicle (EV) fleets in America and launching the first EV carshare program designed for disadvantaged communities. To further improve regional air quality, L.A. Metro and LADOT have set targets to fully electrify their bus fleets by 2030. The City’s numerous different fleets are all piloting and actively pursuing medium and heavy duty electric vehicle opportunities, including a recent pilot of an EV trash truck, electric utility bucket trucks, and a procurement opportunity for electric buses to be used on the airfield at LAX.
