Describe the physical and economic landscape of the jurisdiction as outlined in the plan. Include the name of the planning jurisdiction, its location, population, demographics, and average income. Include major geographic features such as mountains, rivers, deserts, and coastline, as well as any key infrastructure like airports or seaports. Highlight details about the local climate, including any mentions of aridity or water challenges. Additionally, summarize the city’s energy production (oil, gas, renewables) and natural resources, and provide information about industries and economic drivers that are crucial to the region.
 
To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
 
Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
 
What climate hazards does the plan identify as presenting climate risks for the planning jurisdiction? For each identified climate hazard, summarize the plan’s description of: 1. The climate hazard. 2. The climate risks it poses to the planning jurisdiction. 3. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.Generate a numbered list of every hazard identified in the plan. Make the list as long as necessary to accomodate every single hazard.
 
What resilience options are identified in the plan? For each option, summarize: 1. The specific climate threat it addresses; 2. Details on cost, timeframe, and location, including any references found in tables, charts, or images that might contain this data; 3. Other important attributes, such as economic, environmental, or infrastructural considerations.
What mitigation options does the plan identify? For each identified mitigation option, summarize the information provided in the plan regarding cost, timing, location, and other important attributes.

What mitigation options does the plan identify? For each identified mitigation option, summarize the information provided in the plan regarding cost, timeframe, location, and other important attributes.

What adaptation options does the plan identify? For each identified adaptation option, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Information provided in the plan regarding cost, timeframe, location, and other important attributes.

What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
 
Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
 
In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.
 
Generate a table that summarizes the following features from the document: Location/City Name, Population, Threats Identified, Measures Identified
