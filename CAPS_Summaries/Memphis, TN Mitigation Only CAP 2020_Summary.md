### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the content provided from the Memphis Area Climate Action Plan, there are no explicit mentions of potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. The plan emphasizes aligning climate mitigation and adaptation efforts and highlights the use of green infrastructure and energy efficiency as strategies to address climate risks, without indicating any specific maladaptive outcomes. 

However, if we consider general possibilities, potential maladaptive outcomes could arise from:

1. **Policy**: Implementation of green infrastructure
   - **Climate Threat Addressed**: Flooding and extreme heat
   - **Option Proposed**: Use of bioswales, floodable parks, rain gardens, tree cover, and green roofs to reduce flooding risks and energy costs.
   - **Inadvertent Maladaptation**: While the plan does not explicitly state maladaptive outcomes, a potential risk could be the misallocation of resources away from more immediate needs of vulnerable communities or the implementation of green infrastructure in a way that inadvertently increases maintenance costs or displaces local residents.

2. **Policy**: Increasing low-income housing energy efficiency
   - **Climate Threat Addressed**: Extreme heat and cold events
   - **Option Proposed**: Improving energy efficiency in buildings to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and vulnerability.
   - **Inadvertent Maladaptation**: Again, while not explicitly mentioned, a possible maladaptation could occur if the retrofitting of buildings leads to increased housing costs, thus making them less affordable to low-income residents.

The plan does not directly highlight these as risks, but it is important to consider such potential maladaptations when implementing climate policies.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.
**Answer:**
**Metrics for Success or Failure**

The plan outlines several metrics and approaches for measuring the success or failure of adaptation, resilience, and mitigation options:

- **Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** The overarching progress indicators for the plan include a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Specific actions have quantified emission reduction potentials in terms of metric tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) (e.g., Grid Decarbonization aims to achieve reductions of 4,811,919 tCO2e by 2050) (MEMPHIS AREA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, Introduction).

- **Cost Effectiveness:** The plan evaluates the cost-effectiveness of actions by indicating cost savings per ton of CO2 equivalent abated (expressed in $/tCO2e) (e.g., LED Streetlight Retrofit has a cost-effectiveness of -$14 per tCO2e) (MEMPHIS AREA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, Introduction).

- **Energy Sector Emissions:** Specific cumulative emission reductions goals for the energy sector are compared to a business-as-usual scenario, with specific reductions listed for individual actions (MEMPHIS AREA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, Energy).

- **Green Building Standards:** Reduction potential of 178,795 tCO2e by 2035 and 69,775 tCO2e by 2050 (MEMPHIS AREA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, Energy).

- **Urban Tree Canopy:** Reduction potential of 135,781 tCO2e by 2035 and 246,759 tCO2e by 2050 (MEMPHIS AREA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, Energy).

**Concrete Goals and Targets**

- **Long-Term Emission Reduction Targets:** The plan sets a target for a 15% reduction by 2020, 51% by 2035, and 71% by 2050, with an aim for an 80% reduction by 2050 (MEMPHIS AREA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, Introduction).

- **Benchmark Comparisons:** The plan compares its targets to other cities and national/international benchmarks (e.g., the United States aims for 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025) (MEMPHIS AREA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, Energy).

- **Specific Actions:** Various actions have specific numerical goals, such as energy efficiency improvements and implementation of green infrastructure (MEMPHIS AREA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, Energy).

These metrics and targets provide a framework for assessing the effectiveness of the climate action plan and guide ongoing efforts in adaptation, resilience, and mitigation.
