**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes a scenario of climate change that the planning jurisdiction, Phoenix, will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation.

**Scenario Description:**

- The plan outlines a "Business as Usual (BAU)" scenario based on Phoenix’s previous greenhouse gas emissions inventories. Under this scenario, predicted emissions are expected to be 21,192,854 MT CO2eq by 2030 and over 24,562,619 MT CO2eq by 2050. The work aims to determine which climate actions are feasible to help the city meet the reductions necessary to support the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, achieving at least a 50% GHG reduction by 2030 from the 2018 baseline, and becoming a net-zero GHG emissions city by 2050. (*Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions Model*)

- The scenario includes goals and commitments adopted by local leaders and partners, such as the 2050 Sustainability Goals, C40 Cities Deadline 2020, actions by Arizona Public Service and Salt River Project, Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis, expected market trends for electric vehicles, and federal goals to increase electric vehicle sales by 2030. (*WHAT IS IN THE SCENARIO*)

The climate hazard. 2. The climate risks it poses to the planning jurisdiction. 3. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.Generate a numbered list of every hazard identified in the plan. Make the list as long as necessary to accomodate every single hazard.
**Answer:**
1. **Heat**
   - **Climate Hazard:** "Predicted average surface temperatures will increase mildly if GHG emissions are moderately decreased or severely if GHG emissions continue to increase unabated. All predictions indicate that surface temperature will increase over the 21st century and heat waves will occur more often and last longer across the globe."
   - **Climate Risks:** "Exposure to hotter temperatures and heat waves has increased heat-associated deaths in Arizona. During high ozone pollution advisory days, mortality risk is increased if concurrent with a heat wave. Increased heat and drought will affect agriculture as heat stress reduces yield."
   - **Vulnerable Populations:** "Heat extremes and poor air quality from wildfires impact individuals and families who may already be dealing with chronic health conditions, inadequate healthcare or insurance, or a lack of clear and reliable information." Additionally, "communities most vulnerable to heat, particularly within and connecting to Transit Oriented Development Districts, Village Cores, and Centers" are prioritized for shade canopy initiatives.

2. **Droughts**
   - **Climate Hazard:** "Higher temperatures are increasing the drought in the Colorado River Basin and have resulted in a loss of 60% of the volume in Lake Mead, from which Phoenix, along with other cities and agricultural users, draws water."
   - **Climate Risks:** "Risk of water shortages has increased as a result of reduced water volume in Lake Mead and Lake Powell. A Drought Contingency Plan (DCP) was created to require voluntary decreases in water use."
   - **Vulnerable Populations:** The plan does not specify particular populations for droughts, but implies that water security is a city-wide concern necessitating infrastructure projects and conservation efforts.

3. **Wildfires**
   - **Climate Hazard:** "Wildfires have burned twice the area than what would have had climate change not occurred from 1984 until 2015."
   - **Climate Risks:** "Heat extremes and poor air quality from wildfires impact individuals and families who may already be dealing with chronic health conditions, inadequate healthcare or insurance, or a lack of clear and reliable information."
   - **Vulnerable Populations:** Those "dealing with existing burdens" such as chronic health conditions and low access to healthcare are more vulnerable to the impacts of wildfires.

4. **Air Quality**
   - **Climate Hazard:** "During high ozone pollution advisory days, mortality risk is increased if concurrent with a heat wave."
   - **Climate Risks:** Poor air quality exacerbates health risks, especially during heat waves.
   - **Vulnerable Populations:** "Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, lower-income individuals, historically underrepresented groups, children, and older adults" are disproportionately impacted by climate change and poor air quality.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
**1. Potential Maladaptive Climate Policy: Increased Uptake of Electric Vehicles**

- **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy addresses the threat of GHG emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles. "Increases in the uptake of electric vehicles is expected to come when electric vehicles reach price parity with internal combustion engines." (*Financial and Economic*)

- **Option Proposed:** The policy proposes transitioning more internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles as a mitigation option.

- **Potential Maladaptation:** This policy may lead to maladaptation by increasing the demand for electricity without ensuring that the grid is sufficiently decarbonized. "The grid would need to be further decarbonized with a significant increased use of green gas that is not considered feasible at this time." (*Overcoming Barriers to Meeting our Climate Action Goals*)

**2. Potential Maladaptive Climate Policy: Public Transit Expansion**

- **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy addresses the threat of transportation-related GHG emissions by proposing to increase public transit options. "Many of the public comments were to increase public transit options to make it more convenient." (*Practical and Technological*)

- **Option Proposed:** The policy focuses on expanding public transit as a resilience and mitigation option to reduce vehicular emissions.

- **Potential Maladaptation:** It may inadvertently lead to maladaptation if not properly implemented, as "transportation options are difficult to implement in a city as widespread as Phoenix where an average trip distance is 18 miles." The expansion could lead to underutilization of resources if public adoption is low, resulting in financial strain without significant environmental benefits. (*Practical and Technological*)

**3. Potential Maladaptive Climate Policy: Renewable Energy Generation**

- **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy aims to mitigate climate change by increasing renewable energy generation to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. "Many climate actions require significant funding to implement, including increased public transit and renewable energy generation." (*Financial and Economic*)

- **Option Proposed:** Investment in renewable energy infrastructure as a mitigation option.

- **Potential Maladaptation:** This policy may lead to maladaptation if the infrastructure investments do not align with the current grid capabilities or if they inadvertently increase costs to consumers. "This will increase costs to residential customers from $18 per month by 2035 to $60 month by 2050." Such cost increases could disproportionately impact low-income communities and hinder equitable access to clean energy. (*Financial and Economic*)
