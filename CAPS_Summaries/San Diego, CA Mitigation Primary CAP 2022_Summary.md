**Answer:**
**Resilience:**

The plan places a strong emphasis on resilience, as it includes a comprehensive approach to preparing for, adapting to, and recovering from the impacts of a changing climate. The plan, titled *Climate Resilient SD*, aims to protect those most vulnerable to climate change, improve the lives of the city's residents, and build more resilient communities. The plan implements social equity goals by prioritizing investments and resources for Communities of Concern. It outlines strategies that reduce climate change-related risk and works toward building sustainable and equitable communities. 

- "Climate Resilient SD is the City’s comprehensive plan to prepare for, adapt to and recover from the impacts of a changing climate." (Climate Resilient SD)
- "Climate Resilient SD will implement the City’s social equity goals by prioritizing Communities of Concern to ensure investments and resources are prioritized for those with the greatest needs and fewest available resources to adapt." (Climate Resilient SD)

**Mitigation:**

The plan also addresses mitigation through the Climate Action Plan (CAP), which focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to achieve net zero emissions by 2035. The CAP includes strategies such as decarbonization of the built environment, clean and renewable energy, and resilient infrastructure and ecosystems, all aimed at reducing future GHG emissions.

- "To meet the magnitude of the crisis, we are setting an ambitious goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2035." (Introduction)
- "Climate action is a constantly evolving field with new technologies, data, resources and community perspectives shaping the state of the science." (Introduction)

**Adaptation:**

Adaptation is a core component of the plan, with strategies that reduce climate change-related risk and build more resilient communities. The plan identifies key climate change hazards such as sea level rise, flooding, drought, extreme heat, and wildfires, and includes adaptation strategies to address these hazards.

- "The objective of climate change adaptation, on the other hand, is to reduce impacts from climate change-related hazards including extreme heat, extreme rainfall, drought, wildfires and sea level rise." (The Intersections of Climate Action)

**Classification:**

### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan identifies several climate policies to advance climate justice, focusing on different climate threats and targeting specific vulnerable areas or populations:

1. **Climate Equity Fund**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Infrastructure degradation and historical inequities due to lack of investment stemming from redlining.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Communities of Concern, which are predominantly communities of color affected by historical redlining and underinvestment. The Climate Equity Fund is designed to provide funding for infrastructure projects in these areas, addressing historical disparities.

   *"The Mayor and City Council established the Climate Equity Fund to supplement funding for infrastructure projects within Communities of Concern."* (Introduction)

2. **Environmental Justice Element**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Pollution exposure, air quality, and other health burdens.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Neighborhoods disproportionately experiencing pollution and health burdens, specifically Communities of Concern.
   
   *"The EJ element will develop goals, objectives, policies and actions to address the following issues for neighborhoods disproportionately experiencing pollution and other health burdens: Pollution exposure and air quality."* (Environmental Justice Element)

3. **Prioritizing Communities of Concern**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Poor air quality, extreme heat, and infrastructure degradation.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Communities of color, particularly those in the City’s Communities of Concern, who face compounded impacts from climate change and historical inequities.
   
   *"The effects of climate change, such as poor air quality, extreme heat and infrastructure degradation, disproportionately impact communities of color, which are predominantly concentrated within the City’s Communities of Concern."* (Introduction)

4. **Climate Resilient SD**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Extreme heat, wildfires, sea-level rise, flooding, and drought.

   *"Climate Resilient SD focuses on how we can protect those most vulnerable to climate change and improve the lives of the people in our city while preparing for a changing climate."* (Climate Resilient SD)

These policies aim to address specific climate threats while prioritizing investments and resources in historically underserved and climate-vulnerable populations, ensuring that the mitigation and adaptation efforts are equitable and inclusive.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided document, there are no explicit mentions of specific maladaptive climate policies. However, some potential areas where maladaptation could inadvertently occur might be inferred from the context or content of some strategies. Below are examples based on the document's strategies and goals:

1. **Policy: Urban Tree Canopy Assessment and Management**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Increasing risk of extreme heat events and air quality issues.
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** The strategy includes developing a regional Urban Tree Canopy Assessment, issuing an Urban Forest Management Plan, and planning for the long-term maintenance of additional trees (Strategy 5: Resilient Infrastructure and Healthy Ecosystems).
   - **Potential for Maladaptation:** While increasing the urban tree canopy is beneficial for reducing heat island effects, there could be inadvertent maladaptation if the tree species selected are not resilient to future climate conditions, potentially leading to increased water usage or failure to survive in the changing climate. Additionally, if the maintenance and water resources are not adequately planned, it could strain local resources or lead to increased costs.

2. **Policy: Building Electrification**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** GHG emissions from existing and new developments.
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** Develop and adopt a Building Electrification policy to eliminate the use of natural gas in new residential and commercial buildings (Strategy 1: Decarbonization of the Built Environment).
   - **Potential for Maladaptation:** While electrification reduces GHG emissions, it may cause maladaptation if the increased demand for electricity is not met with renewable energy sources, potentially leading to increased reliance on non-renewable sources. Additionally, without adequate infrastructure and affordability measures, it could disproportionately affect low-income communities.

3. **Policy: Increase Electric Vehicle Adoption**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** GHG emissions from transportation.
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** Develop a citywide electric vehicle strategy to accelerate EV adoption (Strategy 2: Clean and Renewable Energy).
   - **Potential for Maladaptation:** The focus on electric vehicles might lead to maladaptation if the energy grid is not sufficiently decarbonized or if the production and disposal of EV batteries are not managed sustainably. Furthermore, this policy could inadvertently increase inequalities if access to EVs and charging infrastructure is not equitably distributed.

These interpretations are speculative and based on an analysis of the document's content with no explicit maladaptive policies identified.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option?
