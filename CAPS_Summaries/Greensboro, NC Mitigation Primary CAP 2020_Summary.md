### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan does not explicitly identify climate policies that directly address climate justice or specify climate threats and populations with the most climate vulnerability in relation to climate justice. The plan does, however, outline various policies and strategies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving sustainability, and supporting adaptation efforts. These broader initiatives may contribute indirectly to climate justice by promoting equitable resource efficiency, economic development, and improved quality of life for all residents. However, specific details on climate justice, such as the identification of vulnerable populations or targeted threats, are not provided in the text.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided excerpts from the Sustainability Action Plan for Greensboro, North Carolina:

1. **Policy 12 - Adaptation**
   - **Climate threat it is addressing:** The policy addresses the potential impacts of climate change on Greensboro, including changes to infrastructure, vegetation, species composition, air quality, and water supply (Chapter 5, 5.8 Adaptation).
   - **Resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option:** The policy proposes developing a framework for adapting to a changing climate and integrating adaptation into Greensboro's plans, ordinances, and programs (Chapter 5, 5.8 Adaptation).
   - **Why it may cause inadvertent maladaptation:** While the policy aims to integrate adaptation into existing structures, without careful consideration, it may lead to maladaptation if the framework does not adequately account for the varying needs of different communities or fails to address the root causes of vulnerability. For instance, prioritizing certain infrastructure projects over others without inclusive stakeholder engagement could potentially exacerbate existing social inequalities or overlook critical ecological impacts.

2. **Strategy 12A. Develop Beneficial Adaptation Strategies and Partnerships**
   - **Climate threat it is addressing:** This strategy is intended to address economic and social vulnerabilities due to climate change, aiming to improve public safety, security, and health (Chapter 5, Strategy 12A).
   - **Resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option:** The strategy suggests prioritizing adaptation strategies that enhance existing efforts to improve economic and social well-being, and establish partnerships with various entities (Chapter 5, Strategy 12A).
   - **Why it may cause inadvertent maladaptation:** The focus on enhancing existing efforts could inadvertently neglect emerging threats or novel solutions. By heavily investing in current systems or partnerships, the city might reinforce outdated practices or create dependency on specific partners, which could limit flexibility and innovation in the face of rapidly changing climate conditions.

Both policies emphasize adaptation and partnership-building but must be carefully managed to avoid reinforcing existing vulnerabilities or excluding crucial stakeholder voices, which could lead to maladaptive outcomes.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option?
