**Answer:**
The plan provided does not include specific information on the physical and economic landscape of the planning jurisdiction, including details such as location, population, demographics, average income, geographic features, or key infrastructure. However, the plan does mention some aspects related to the local climate and energy production:

- **Location**: The plan refers to the City of Anaheim, which is located in California, USA.

- **Local Climate and Water Challenges**: The plan notes that "As the 2015 GHG plan was being written, California was experiencing a historic drought." It also emphasizes water conservation efforts: "Anaheim continued to promote water conservation as a way of life in this new normalized environment." (Source: Water Conservation and Drought Resiliency)

- **Energy Production and Natural Resources**: 
  - The plan highlights investments in renewable energy: "APU met its 2020 renewable energy procurement goal of 33%." (Source: Investments in Renewable Power Supplies)
  - Renewable resources include solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas energy, geothermal energy, and small-scale hydro power. (Source: Qualifying Renewable Resources)

### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
### Resilience

The plan includes elements that enhance resilience, particularly through water conservation and drought resiliency efforts. These efforts are highlighted in the document: 

- "Anaheim continued to promote water conservation as a way of life in this new normalized environment." (*Water Conservation and Drought Resiliency*)
- The plan emphasizes "reducing water waste at city facilities and local businesses" and recognizes projects like "drought-tolerant landscapes that feature California-native plants and drip irrigation." (*Notable Accomplishments, 2015—2020*)

### Mitigation

The plan places a significant emphasis on mitigation strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Key components include:

- The reduction of GHG emissions by "1,908,300 MTCO2e through 2020" and doubling the 2020 target with a reduction of "40% or 940,000 MTCO2e" from power supplies. (*Summarizing APU's Accomplishments*, *GHG Reductions from Power Supplies*)
- Investments in renewable energy, such as "methane capture power generation system" and "large-scale solar project." (*Investments in Renewable Power Supplies*)
- The transition towards electric vehicles (EVs) with a focus on reducing emissions from the city fleet and providing "rebate assistance" for transitioning to EVs. (*Fleet Electric Vehicles*)

### Adaptation

The plan also incorporates adaptation measures, though these are less prominent compared to mitigation efforts. Adaptation-focused initiatives include:

- "Water Recycling Demonstration Facility" and the use of recycled water for irrigation to adapt to drought conditions. (*Notable Accomplishments, 2015—2020*)

### Classification

Based on the emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy investments, water conservation efforts, and the transition to electric vehicles, the plan is best classified as a **"mitigation primary climate action plan."**

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
The plan does not explicitly describe a detailed scenario of climate change impacts that Anaheim will face. Instead, it outlines the goals and actions taken to address climate change, focusing on greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy investments, water conservation, and other sustainability initiatives. The plan is aligned with state policies and legislative mandates such as Senate Bill 100, which envisions a carbon-free energy future in California by 2045. 

The plan emphasizes transitioning from fossil fuels to sustainable and renewable resources, aiming to achieve a "carbon-free" electricity supply by 2045. It also highlights the importance of water conservation as a response to the historic drought experienced by California. However, it does not describe specific climate change scenarios or impacts that Anaheim might face in the future. Instead, it focuses on the current and future efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing sustainability through various initiatives.
