### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the content provided from the climate plans for Lincoln, here are potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies:

1. **Policy: Auto-Reliant Transportation System**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy addresses the threat of greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, particularly from combustion engine vehicles. 
   
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** The policy aims to reduce emissions by encouraging the transition to electric vehicles and promoting active commuting.
   
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** While transitioning to electric vehicles can reduce emissions, it may inadvertently lead to increased reliance on personal vehicles, which could exacerbate urban sprawl and congestion. Electric vehicles still require significant resources for battery production and charging infrastructure, potentially straining local resources if not managed properly. This could also lead to social inequality if electric vehicle adoption is only accessible to higher-income residents, leaving others reliant on less sustainable transportation options.

2. **Policy: Transition from Natural Gas to All-Electric Systems**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy aims to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels, which are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions.
   
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** The strategy involves creating incentives for homeowners to adopt all-electric heating and cooking systems and requiring new homes to be built with all-electric HVAC systems.
   
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** Transitioning to all-electric systems could lead to increased demand on the electrical grid, potentially causing reliability issues if the infrastructure is not updated to handle the increased load. There may also be unintended economic impacts on residents who cannot afford to switch to electric systems or who face higher energy costs, thereby increasing energy vulnerability for low-income households.

3. **Policy: Infill Basements at Risk of Flooding**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy addresses the threat of flooding, particularly in areas identified as floodplains.
   
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** The policy considers a voluntary, incentives-based approach to infilling basements in flood-prone areas to minimize flood damage.
   
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** While infilling basements can prevent flood damage, it may inadvertently reduce the usable space in homes and thus lead to decreased property values. Additionally, it may not address the root causes of flooding and could give residents a false sense of security, potentially leading to less investment in other necessary flood mitigation measures.

These potential maladaptations highlight the importance of comprehensive planning that considers long-term impacts and equity in climate policy implementation.
