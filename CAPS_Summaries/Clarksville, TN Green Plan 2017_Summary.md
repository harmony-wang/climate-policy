### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
**Policy: Development of tax break or incentives for “Green” building and use of Low-Impact Development (LID) methods**

1. **Climate Threat Addressed:**
   - The policy aims to address issues related to stormwater management and reducing environmental impacts from urban development, as well as promoting energy conservation.

   - The policy proposes resilience options through encouraging the use of Low-Impact Development (LID) methods, which are designed to manage stormwater runoff using small-scale landscape practices and design approaches.

3. **Potential for Maladaptation:**
   - The policy might inadvertently cause maladaptation if the tax breaks or incentives lead to developments that prioritize LID methods over more effective or necessary climate adaptation measures. For example, if LID methods are employed in areas where they are not suitable due to soil or climate conditions, they might fail to effectively manage stormwater, potentially exacerbating flooding issues rather than mitigating them. Additionally, if the incentivization focuses narrowly on LID without considering broader environmental impacts, it might lead to developments that do not comprehensively address climate vulnerabilities. 

**Policy: Encourage sustainable practices that will mitigate flood damage**

1. **Climate Threat Addressed:**
   - This policy aims to address the threat of increased flooding due to climate change.

2. **Option Proposed:**
   - The policy suggests resilience options by encouraging sustainable practices to mitigate flood damage, potentially including infrastructure improvements, land-use planning, and other adaptive measures.

3. **Potential for Maladaptation:**
   - There is a risk of maladaptation if the encouraged practices do not consider the full spectrum of climate impacts or if they are implemented without thorough risk assessments. For instance, if flood mitigation practices are not well-integrated with other climate adaptation strategies, they might lead to unintended consequences like habitat disruption or increased flood risk in adjacent areas. Furthermore, if these practices are not flexible enough to adapt to future climate scenarios, they could become obsolete or even counterproductive as climate conditions change.
