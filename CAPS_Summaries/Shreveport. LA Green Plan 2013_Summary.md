### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
**Potential Unforeseen Maladaptive Climate Policies:**

1. **Policy:** Continued conversion of government vehicles to compressed natural gas (CNG).
   - **Climate Threat it is Addressing:** This policy addresses the need to reduce fossil fuel use and emissions from transportation.
   - **Option Proposed:** The policy proposes a mitigation option by converting vehicles to use CNG, which is considered a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels.
   - **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:** While CNG is cleaner than some other fossil fuels, it is still a non-renewable resource and can contribute to methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. This could potentially lock the city into using another fossil fuel source long-term, instead of transitioning to renewable energy solutions, leading to a delay in achieving more sustainable energy goals. Additionally, the infrastructure investments in CNG could divert resources from developing renewable energy infrastructure.

2. **Policy:** Use of technical consultants to establish a greenhouse gas (GHG) baseline and facilitate the comprehensive Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan process.
   - **Climate Threat it is Addressing:** The policy addresses the threat of high GHG emissions.
   - **Option Proposed:** This is a resilience option aimed at creating a robust plan to reduce energy usage and GHG emissions.
   - **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:** Relying heavily on external consultants for planning may result in solutions that are not fully tailored to local conditions or needs, potentially overlooking community-specific vulnerabilities or priorities. This could lead to inefficiencies or solutions that are not sustainable in the long term, thereby reducing the overall efficacy of the climate action plan.

3. **Policy:** Integration of natural stormwater-management features in rights-of-way of new and updated roadways and streetscapes.
   - **Climate Threat it is Addressing:** This policy aims to manage stormwater runoff and reduce pollution in waterways.
   - **Option Proposed:** It is an adaptation option that uses natural drainage systems to manage stormwater.
   - **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:** If not properly designed or maintained, these natural stormwater systems could become ineffective over time, leading to increased flooding or water management issues. Additionally, if climate projections change and these systems are not adaptable, they may not cope with increased storm intensity or frequency, thus exacerbating flooding risks rather than mitigating them.

4. **Policy:** Promote and require best management practices by natural gas operators and property owners.
   - **Climate Threat it is Addressing:** It addresses water and soil protection from contamination due to drilling activities.
   - **Option Proposed:** It is an adaptation and mitigation option aimed at reducing environmental impacts from the oil and gas industry.
   - **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:** By focusing on best practices rather than transitioning away from fossil fuel reliance, this policy may inadvertently perpetuate dependence on fossil fuels, delaying the transition to renewable energy sources. Moreover, if regulations are not strictly enforced, the intended environmental protections might not be realized, leading to potential degradation of natural resources despite the policy's intentions.
