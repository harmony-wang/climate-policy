**Answer:**
Based on the provided document, there are no explicit mentions of policies that are identified as potentially causing maladaptation. However, a close analysis of the proposed strategies can highlight areas where unforeseen maladaptive outcomes might occur. Here are some potential areas to consider:

1. **Resilient Innovation Districts (RIDs)**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The RIDs aim to address GHG emissions and enhance resilience against climate impacts such as floods.
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** The policy proposes establishing Resilient Innovation Districts to integrate low carbon and resilient business models, which aim to reduce emissions and create economic opportunities. As stated, "The suggested approach is to establish a set of Resilient Innovation Districts...to ‘rid’ itself of CO2e emissions while ensuring resilience and maximizing job opportunities" (Action Area 4).
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** While the RIDs are designed to create resilience and reduce emissions, if not carefully managed, they could inadvertently lead to increased inequality or gentrification. By focusing on innovation districts, there is a risk that benefits may not be equitably distributed across all communities, potentially exacerbating social vulnerabilities.

2. **Tree Canopy Management**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy is aimed at maintaining and enhancing the urban tree canopy to mitigate urban heat and act as a carbon sink.
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** The tree canopy provides cooling effects and reduces CO2 emissions. "Charlotte’s trees provide a cooling effect to the City, helping to drop temperatures caused by the Urban Heat Island Effect. The canopy also acts as a carbon sink" (Charlotte’s Urban Forest).
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** If the focus is solely on preserving the existing tree canopy without considering future climate conditions or diverse species planting, there might be a risk of maladaptation. A monoculture approach or failure to account for pests and diseases could lead to a vulnerability in the urban forest, making it less resilient to future climate changes.

3. **Energy Procurement Policies**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy seeks to address energy consumption and GHG emissions through sustainable procurement practices.
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** Strengthening procurement policies to focus on energy-efficient appliances and lighting, and integrating renewable energy sources. "Change procurement requirements of lighting and appliances" (Internal Action Areas).
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** If these procurement policies do not consider the life cycle impacts or the social and economic context of the technologies, they could lead to increased costs and reduced accessibility for certain populations, inadvertently increasing energy poverty.

These areas highlight the importance of inclusive and comprehensive planning to avoid potential maladaptive outcomes.
