These adaptation options are part of a broader strategy to proactively respond to climate change and protect Chicago's people, infrastructure, and natural resources. The plan emphasizes advancing policies and solutions to prepare for a changing climate.

### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan does not explicitly mention specific climate policies aimed directly at advancing climate justice, nor does it provide details on climate threats or areas/populations with the most climate vulnerability in relation to climate justice. Instead, the plan broadly addresses climate change and related goals such as reducing carbon emissions, improving air quality, and preparing for climate impacts. 

The plan does include some elements that could be related to climate justice, such as community engagement and the closure of coal-fired power plants to improve air quality, but it does not explicitly frame these actions in a climate justice context. Here are relevant excerpts:

- **Reducing Carbon Emissions and Community Engagement**: 
  - The plan aims to "reduce carbon emissions from all sectors" which includes "increase community engagement to make Chicago more sustainable" (_"GOAL 22"_). This can indirectly address climate justice by involving communities in sustainability efforts.

- **Improving Air Quality**:
  - The closure of Fisk and Crawford generating stations is highlighted as a significant milestone towards improving air quality (_"GOAL 23"_). While this action addresses air pollution, the plan does not specify which populations are most vulnerable to this threat.

- **Protecting Residents from Climate Changes**:
  - The plan indicates preparing for climate changes by supporting people with information and services such as cooling centers (_"GOAL 24"_). This may help vulnerable populations during extreme heat but is not explicitly linked to climate justice.

Without specific mention of climate justice, it is not possible to draw direct relationships between the identified climate policies and areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability as per the document provided.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the document provided, no specific climate policies have been explicitly identified as maladaptive. However, it is possible to analyze the proposed options for potential unforeseen maladaptive outcomes:

1. **Policy: Reducing urban heat island effect and managing flooding from high-intensity storm events**
   - **Climate Threat:** This policy addresses the climate threat of increased urban temperatures and flooding due to high-intensity storm events.
   - **Option:** The resilience option proposed includes preparing the infrastructure to reduce the urban heat island effect and managing flooding.
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** While addressing the urban heat island effect and flooding, there might be a risk of maladaptation if, for example, the measures implemented inadvertently lead to increased energy consumption (e.g., increased use of air conditioning) or if flood management infrastructure negatively impacts local ecosystems or water quality.

2. **Policy: Increasing vehicle efficiency**
   - **Climate Threat:** This policy is aimed at reducing carbon emissions and improving air quality.
   - **Option:** The mitigation option involves strengthening infrastructure to advance vehicle efficiency.
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** There is a potential for maladaptation if the focus on vehicle efficiency results in increased reliance on personal vehicles rather than promoting more sustainable public transportation options, thus potentially increasing overall emissions and urban congestion.

These potential maladaptations are speculative based on the types of strategies typically employed in these scenarios. The document does not specify direct instances of maladaptation.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option?
