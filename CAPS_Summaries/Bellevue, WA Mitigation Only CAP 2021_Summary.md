### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan identifies several climate policies to advance climate justice, focusing on addressing climate threats and targeting vulnerable populations. Here are the summarized policies:

1. **Climate Equity (C.1.4)**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy addresses the general threat of climate change impacts, including mitigation and adaptation needs.
   - **Vulnerable Populations:** It prioritizes climate mitigation and adaptation investments in "historically underserved and underrepresented communities" and aims to support "Bellevue’s communities of color." The policy emphasizes the need to engage with these communities to design projects that meet their needs.

   *"Prioritize climate mitigation and adaptation investments in historically underserved and underrepresented communities."* (CLIMATE CHANGE 41)

2. **Environmental Equity Assessment (C.1.5)**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy seeks to address environmental risks, which may include various climate-related hazards.
   - **Vulnerable Populations:** It focuses on "communities of color" to ensure equitable access to environmental resources and reduce environmental burdens. The assessment is used to inform policy and program recommendations to advance equity.

   *"Perform an environmental equity assessment to identify environmental risks to communities of color and equitable access to environmental resources in Bellevue."* (IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 113)

3. **General Equity Considerations in Implementation**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The plan does not specify a single climate threat but rather seeks to mitigate burdens and disparities caused by climate-related actions.
   - **Vulnerable Populations:** This involves communities of color, low-income populations, and minority-owned businesses. The plan emphasizes shared benefits, accessibility, and engagement to ensure these groups are not disproportionately impacted by climate actions.

   *"Does the proposed action generate burdens (including costs), either directly or indirectly, to communities of color or low-income populations?"* (IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 132)

These policies collectively aim to integrate climate justice considerations into Bellevue's environmental planning and actions, ensuring that the benefits of climate policies are equitably distributed and that vulnerable populations are actively involved in the decision-making process.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based strictly on the document provided, there is no explicit mention of specific climate policies that may lead to unforeseen maladaptive outcomes. The document focuses on strategies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, preparing for climate impacts, and ensuring equity in climate action.

However, I can provide an analysis of two policies that could potentially lead to maladaptation if not carefully implemented, based on the principles outlined in the document:

### Potential Maladaptive Climate Policies:

1. **Policy: Climate Equity (C.1.4)**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:**
     - The policy addresses the disproportionate impact of climate change on historically underserved and underrepresented communities, such as those facing severe heat and wildfire smoke.

   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:**
     - This policy prioritizes climate mitigation and adaptation investments in historically underserved and underrepresented communities to ensure equity in the face of climate change impacts. (*"Prioritize climate mitigation and adaptation investments in historically underserved and underrepresented communities."* - Strategy C.1.4)

   - **Potential Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
     - If not implemented with thorough community engagement and understanding of local contexts, there is a risk that interventions may not align with the true needs and priorities of the communities they intend to serve. This could lead to investments that do not effectively build resilience or even exacerbate existing vulnerabilities by overlooking local knowledge and preferences.

2. **Policy: Comprehensive Plan Update (C.1.8)**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:**
     - The need to institutionalize climate action and ensure integration of climate resilience into city planning and infrastructure development.

   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:**
     - Updating the Comprehensive Plan to reflect the Environmental Stewardship Plan as a functional plan aims to institutionalize future updates and integrate climate considerations into broader city planning. (*"Update the Comprehensive Plan to reflect that the Environmental Stewardship Plan is a functional plan."* - Strategy C.1.8)

   - **Potential Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
     - If the integration process emphasizes rigid adherence to the plan without allowing for adaptive management or flexibility, it may limit the ability to respond to emerging climate data or innovative solutions. This could result in outdated or ineffective strategies that fail to address the dynamic nature of climate risks.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option?
