### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
**Resilience:**

The plan includes several strategies that contribute to building resilience, although it does not comprehensively address resilience as a standalone focus. For instance, the plan mentions the development of a "Climate Adaptation Plan" which is crucial for preparing for climate change effects like air quality, fires, floods, and energy and water supply (Greener Glendale Plan: Municipal Operations Page 55 of 100). Additionally, it highlights the importance of a "Smart Grid Installation," which improves efficiency and response time, potentially aiding in resilience across multiple sectors (Greener Glendale Plan: Municipal Operations Page 54 of 100).

**Mitigation:**

The plan has a strong focus on mitigation through specific GHG reduction targets and strategies. It sets a target for reducing GHG emissions by 6,352 MTCO2e by 2020 and an additional 4,834 MTCO2e by 2035 (Greener Glendale Plan: Municipal Operations Page 18 of 100). The plan addresses various domains, including energy efficiency, transportation, and waste management, to mitigate climate change effects. It also discusses the statutory requirement under SB 375 to establish regional transportation-related greenhouse gas targets (Greener Glendale Plan: Municipal Operations Page 15 of 100).

**Adaptation:**

Adaptation is addressed but not as extensively as mitigation. The plan acknowledges the inevitability of additional climate impacts despite mitigation efforts. It notes the need for "adaptation planning" and the development of a "Climate Adaptation Plan" (Greener Glendale Plan: Municipal Operations Page 18 of 100). It also briefly discusses climate impacts specific to Glendale, such as high fire hazard areas and air pollution susceptibility (Greener Glendale Plan: Municipal Operations Page 18 of 100).

**Classification of the Plan:**

Overall, the plan can be classified as a **sustainable/green plan**. This is because it comprehensively addresses various sustainability aspects, including both mitigation and some elements of adaptation and resilience, as part of a broader approach to sustainability.

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes several scenarios of climate change that the planning jurisdiction, Glendale, will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation. These scenarios include:

- **Increased Average Temperatures and Temperature Extremes:** The plan notes that "California is already experiencing the effects of climate change," with increased average temperatures and changes in temperature extremes. These trends are expected to continue and intensify (Greener Glendale Plan: Municipal Operations, Climate Change Adaptation).

- **Reduced Snow Pack and Water Supply Strain:** The reduced snow pack in the Sierra Nevada is expected to further strain Glendale's water supply (Greener Glendale Plan: Municipal Operations, Climate Change Adaptation).

- **Increased Frequency of Extreme Weather Events:** Extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, and floods, are expected to intensify (Greener Glendale Plan: Municipal Operations, Climate Change Adaptation).

- **High Fire Hazard Areas and Mudslide Danger:** With 62% of Glendale's land area within a high fire hazard area, largely due to the urban-wildland interface, there is a severe mudslide danger for years following wildfires (Greener Glendale Plan: Municipal Operations, Climate Change Adaptation).

- **Air Pollution Exacerbated by Geography and Weather Patterns:** The city faces a higher than average susceptibility to freeway air pollution due to its location near major freeways and its position in the South Coast Air Basin, where pollution becomes trapped (Greener Glendale Plan: Municipal Operations, Climate Change Adaptation).

- **Increased Risks to Water Supplies and Ecosystems:** The Southwest region, including Glendale, should expect increasing scarcity of water supplies, transformation of landscapes due to temperature increases, drought, wildfire, and invasive species, and increased risks to people, ecosystems, and infrastructure due to altered timing of flooding (Greener Glendale Plan: Municipal Operations, Climate Change Impacts).

These scenarios highlight the need for climate policies focusing on resilience, mitigation, and adaptation to address these anticipated changes and impacts.
