**Answer:**
**Resilience:**

The plan strongly emphasizes resilience by outlining strategies to make resilience ideals a part of everyday business and long-term strategy. This is evident in the various goals and strategies aimed at integrating resilience into planning and operations. For example, under Goal 4: Planning and Integration, the plan intends to "mainstream vulnerability assessments and resilience adaptation into the City's guiding strategies, plans, and policies" and to "track and share dynamic risk, climate, and social vulnerability data to support multi-sector resilience decision making" (GOAL 4: PLANNING AND INTEGRATION).

**Mitigation:**

Mitigation is also addressed in the plan, particularly in Goal 2: Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation, which includes strategies such as "reduce energy use and achieve net zero local greenhouse gas emissions" (GOAL 2: HAZARD MITIGATION AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION) and "incentivize sustainable building design and construction" (Strategy 2.5: Future-proof our built environment).

**Adaptation:**

Adaptation is highlighted through various strategies aimed at adjusting systems to the expected impacts of climate change. The plan includes actions such as updating the Local Mitigation Strategy and Comprehensive Emergency Management Plans with climate change vulnerability assessments and adaptation strategies (GOAL 4: PLANNING AND INTEGRATION).

**Classification:**

The plan can be classified as an **equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan** because it addresses both mitigation and adaptation thoroughly, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience through adaptation strategies.

### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan identifies several climate policies to advance climate justice, particularly focused on addressing climate vulnerabilities and enhancing social equity:

### **Policy 1: Provide Safe Shelter for All and Increase Pathways to Secure Affordable Housing**

1. **Climate Threat Addressed:**
   - This policy addresses **housing insecurity**, which is exacerbated by climate hazards such as extreme weather events and their associated risks.

2. **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:**
   - Populations most vulnerable include those experiencing **housing insecurity and homelessness**. The plan emphasizes that "[...] when people have safe and stable housing, they are better protected from climate hazards" (GOAL 3: EQUITY AND SOCIAL COHESION).

### **Policy 2: Support Financial Security and Connect Vulnerable Individuals to Safety Net Services**

1. **Climate Threat Addressed:**
   - This policy targets **economic vulnerabilities** that may be exacerbated by climate-related shocks and stresses.

2. **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:**
   - Vulnerable populations include **financially insecure individuals** who may lack the resources to recover from climate impacts and are therefore more susceptible to long-term socioeconomic stresses.

### **Policy 3: Expand Safe, Affordable, and Environmentally Friendly Alternatives for People to Travel**

1. **Climate Threat Addressed:**
   - This policy addresses **transportation vulnerabilities** that limit access to essential services during climate events.

2. **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:**
   - Populations with limited mobility options, particularly **low-income and elderly residents** who may depend on public transportation to access economic, educational, and recreational opportunities (GOAL 3: EQUITY AND SOCIAL COHESION).

### **Policy 4: Grow the Local Food Ecosystem and Advance Food Security**

1. **Climate Threat Addressed:**
   - This policy seeks to mitigate **food insecurity**, which can be intensified by climate-related disruptions affecting food supply chains.

2. **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:**
   - Vulnerable populations include those with limited access to healthful food options, often found in **economically disadvantaged neighborhoods**.

The plan outlines these policies to ensure that the benefits of climate resilience efforts are equitably distributed, and that vulnerable communities are supported in building adaptive capacity and reducing their exposure to climate risks.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based strictly on the content provided in the document, the following potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies can be identified:

### **Policy 1: Tree Trimming Program**

1. **Climate Threat Addressed:** 
   - Wildfire threat and damage to utility infrastructure due to trees.
   
2. **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option Proposed:**
   - The plan proposes to "continue tree trimming program along all overhead utility corridors and mitigate trees that cause damage to existing rights-of-way." (_Goal 2: Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation - Initial Actions_)

3. **Potential Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
   - While intended to reduce wildfire risk and protect infrastructure, excessive or inappropriate tree trimming could inadvertently reduce urban tree canopy, leading to increased urban heat island effects and reduced carbon sequestration capacity, thus increasing vulnerability to extreme heat and air quality issues.

### **Policy 2: Prescribed Burning**

1. **Climate Threat Addressed:** 
   - Wildfire threat, especially in areas with dense vegetation and potential surface fuels. 

2. **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option Proposed:**
   - Prescribed burning is used as a strategy to mitigate wildfire risk by reducing the volume of debris that could fuel wildfires. (_Our Resilience Challenges - Wildfire_)

3. **Potential Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
   - Although prescribed burning helps mitigate wildfire risk, it "can also create intermittent poor air quality that affects sensitive populations." Thus, it may inadvertently increase health risks, particularly for vulnerable groups such as those with respiratory issues.

### **Policy 3: Flood-Prone Area Development Restrictions**

1. **Climate Threat Addressed:** 
   - Flooding in areas such as near the Orange Avenue and Springhill Road corridors.

2. **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option Proposed:**
   - The plan suggests preventing new building developments in high-risk areas such as land within the 25-year flood zone. (_Goal 2: Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation - Initial Actions_)

3. **Potential Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
   - While intended to prevent flood damage, restricting development in flood-prone areas could inadvertently lead to increased housing shortages or drive development towards other ecologically sensitive areas, potentially causing habitat destruction or increasing vulnerability elsewhere.

These policies, while well-intentioned, highlight the complex balance required in climate adaptation planning to avoid inadvertent maladaptive outcomes.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.
**Answer:**
The plan outlines several metrics, goals, and targets to measure the success of adaptation, resilience, and mitigation options:

### **Metrics and Measurements:**

1. **Energy Use Reduction:**
   - *Goal:* Achieve a 50% reduction in energy use intensity at city-operated facilities by 2024.

6. **Hazard Mitigation Grants:**
   - *Metric:* Expansion and promotion of home hazard mitigation grant program for low-income households.

7. **Capital Improvement Projects:**
