The push for energy efficiency is seen as a way to save money, create jobs, conserve resources, and increase energy independence, thus enhancing economic competitiveness ("Letter to the Lexington Community").

**Summary:**  
The Empower Lexington plan aims to position Lexington as a sustainable and resilient community by improving energy efficiency, which is expected to have broad economic benefits, including job creation and cost savings.

### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
**Resilience:**

The plan addresses resilience by aiming to make Lexington more energy aware, efficient, and sustainable. It highlights the importance of preserving greenspace and vegetated lands, emphasizing that these actions "enhance quality of life, improve environmental quality, and provide recreational and alternative transportation opportunities" (EMPOWER LEXINGTON PLAN, Page 20). Additionally, the plan promotes protection of farmland, which is essential for maintaining environmental quality and enhancing resilience against climate impacts (EMPOWER LEXINGTON PLAN, Page 20).

**Mitigation:**

The plan is heavily focused on mitigation efforts, as evidenced by its commitment to reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. The plan's primary goal is an "annual 1% reduction in our community’s energy use or more" (EMPOWER LEXINGTON PLAN, Page 43). The plan outlines various strategies and recommendations across sectors like transportation, waste, residential, land use, and industrial/commercial/institutional to achieve these reductions (EMPOWER LEXINGTON PLAN, Page 4-5). The emphasis on energy efficiency and conservation is a clear mitigation strategy to curb emissions.

**Adaptation:**

While the plan does not explicitly focus on adaptation, it includes elements that may contribute to adaptation indirectly. The protection of greenspace and support for farmland preservation can be seen as measures that contribute to the adaptive capacity of the community by maintaining ecosystem services and reducing vulnerability to climate impacts (EMPOWER LEXINGTON PLAN, Page 20).

**Classification:**

The plan can be classified as a **mitigation primary climate action plan**. It places a strong emphasis on reducing energy use and emissions, which are core mitigation activities, while also incorporating some resilience-building measures. However, adaptation is not a primary focus of the plan.

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
The plan does not explicitly describe a specific scenario of climate change that the planning jurisdiction will face. However, it does acknowledge the general increase in energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions if no action is taken. The plan states:

- "Kentucky’s energy use is projected to grow by slightly more than 40 percent between now and 2025 under a Business-As-Usual scenario" (Executive Summary).
  
- "In forecasting future energy use and emissions, US Census projections are the main tool we have to project (forecast) likely increases... We chose to forecast emissions for years 2015 and 2025 using Lexington’s anticipated population for these years as forecasted by the US Census Bureau" (Page 40).

This implies that without intervention, Lexington will face increased energy demand and associated emissions, necessitating the development of climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation.

### Question: What climate hazards does the plan identify as presenting climate risks for the planning jurisdiction? For each identified climate hazard, summarize the plan’s description of: 1.

(*"Promote best management practices for agricultural, residential, and commercial areas that maintain vegetation that sequesters carbon dioxide, preserves soil, and reduces surface water runoff."* - Page 22)

Overall, the plan emphasizes energy efficiency and emission reduction strategies rather than direct climate adaptation measures.

### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
Based on the content provided from the Empower Lexington Plan, there are no specific climate policies identified that directly advance climate justice. The excerpts do not explicitly mention policies addressing climate justice or particular climate threats, nor do they specify areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to identified climate hazards. The focus of the plan appears to be on energy efficiency, emissions reduction, land preservation, and best management practices for environmental quality and carbon sequestration. If there are specific sections addressing climate justice, they were not included in the provided excerpts.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
**1. Policy: Infill Development Strategy**

- **Climate Threat Addressed:** The strategy addresses the threat of greenhouse gas emissions and urban sprawl.
  
- **Option Proposed:** The policy proposes infill development as a "particularly effective method" to accommodate growth while "curbing excessive greenhouse gas emissions through the use of mass transportation, mixed-use and energy-efficient development, increased density, and preservation of greenspace" (Empower Lexington Plan, Recommendations).

- **Potential Maladaptation:** While infill development can reduce urban sprawl and emissions, increasing density without adequate infrastructure planning may lead to overcrowding, strain on public services, and reduced quality of life. If not carefully managed, it could inadvertently increase vulnerability to climate impacts such as heatwaves, due to the urban heat island effect, and flooding, if stormwater systems are not upgraded to handle increased runoff.

**2. Policy: Tree Canopy Expansion**

- **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy addresses climate threats related to carbon emissions and urban heat.

- **Option Proposed:** The plan recommends "establishing and maintaining a healthy tree canopy of 40% in residential areas, and 20% in commercial developments" (Empower Lexington Plan, Recommendations).

- **Potential Maladaptation:** While increasing tree canopy can sequester carbon and moderate temperatures, it may lead to maladaptation if non-native or water-intensive species are planted, potentially increasing water usage and affecting local biodiversity. Additionally, poorly planned tree planting could interfere with infrastructure and utilities, leading to increased maintenance costs and service disruptions.

**3. Policy: Retrofit Finance Approaches**

- **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy targets high energy usage and associated emissions from residential buildings.

- **Option Proposed:** It suggests promoting "innovative retrofit financing mechanisms such as on-bill utility service retrofits funded over time with realized cost savings" (Empower Lexington Plan, Recommendations).

- **Potential Maladaptation:** While financing mechanisms can facilitate energy efficiency improvements, they may lead to maladaptation if they disproportionately benefit wealthier households or increase debt burdens on low-income residents, potentially exacerbating social vulnerabilities and creating inequitable access to climate adaptation benefits.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.
**Answer:**
**Measuring Success or Failure:**

1. **Energy Use Reduction:**
   - The plan sets a target for the community to achieve an annual 1% reduction in energy use, measured in absolute terms and per capita. This is described as "an annual 1% reduction in our community’s energy use" when compared to the current usage (Empower Lexington Plan, Page 43).

2. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory:**
   - A greenhouse gas inventory for Lexington-Fayette County is to be completed using Clean Air and Climate Protection software for the calendar year 2011. This will serve as a "new baseline year" for measuring success (Empower Lexington Plan, Page 43).

3. **Periodic Reviews:**
   - The plan includes periodic reviews every two years by stakeholder teams to monitor and verify implementation. Results are communicated to the public and the Urban County Council (Empower Lexington Plan, Page 43).

4. **Community-wide Emissions Quantification:**
   - Community-wide emissions are quantified at least every 5 years using Clean Air and Climate Protection software (Empower Lexington Plan, Page 43).

5. **Historical Baseline and Forecasting:**
   - The baseline year of 2007 is used for historical comparison, and future emissions are projected using this baseline under a "business as usual" scenario (Empower Lexington Plan, Page 40).

6. **Emissions by Sector:**
   - The plan includes an inventory of emissions by sector (residential, commercial, industrial, transportation, waste/water) with specific percentages assigned to each (Empower Lexington Plan, Page 40).

**Concrete Goals or Targets:**

1. **Reduction Target:**
   - "A minimum of 1% per year" reduction in energy use, which is described as achievable and within the community's grasp (Empower Lexington Plan, Page 5).

2. **Vehicle Emissions Standards:**
   - By 2018, GHG emissions will be reduced by 17% for diesel heavy-duty vehicles and 12% for heavy-duty gasoline vehicles (Empower Lexington Plan, Page 25).

3. **Alternative Fuels:**
   - Ethanol blends can cut carbon by 2% for E10 and by 60% for E85 blends. Compressed natural gas can reduce carbon emissions by 25%, and electric vehicles can achieve 65% reductions (Empower Lexington Plan, Page 25).

4. **LexTran Ridership:**
   - LexTran ridership has increased over 50% since 2004, aiming to continue this trend to reduce transportation emissions (Empower Lexington Plan, Page 25).

**Units and Metrics:**

- **Energy Use:** Measured per capita and in absolute terms.
- **GHG Emissions:** Measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCE).
- **Emissions Inventory:** Detailed in terms of scope and sector contributions.
- **Emission Reductions for Vehicles:** Expressed in percentage reductions.
