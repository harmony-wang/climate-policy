**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes scenarios of climate change that the planning jurisdiction, Los Angeles, will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation.

**Scenario: Sea Level Rise and Coastal Hazards**

- Los Angeles is anticipated to experience accelerated sea-level rise of one to two feet over the next 30 years and six feet or more by the end of the century. This increase will impact coastal infrastructure, ports, and beaches, leading to flooding during high tides, increased coastal erosion, potential for landslides, and saltwater contamination of freshwater sources *(Resilient Los Angeles, Coastal Hazards, Page 80)*.

**Scenario: Extreme Weather and Heat**

- Climate change is creating hazards such as extreme heat, drought, severe weather, and coastal flooding that pose significant environmental, social, and economic risks for cities across the globe *(Resilient Los Angeles, Goal 12, Page 127)*.

Los Angeles is planning various policies to address these scenarios, including resilience strategies, adaptation through planning and infrastructure improvements, and mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate impact.
**Answer:**
### Climate Policies Advancing Climate Justice

1. **Develop an Urban Heat Vulnerability Index and Mitigation Plan**
   - **Climate Threat:** Higher temperatures and more frequent extreme heat.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** The plan aims to prioritize neighborhoods, engage stakeholders, and identify populations most at risk of heat-related health problems. The focus is on creating policies to support heat-resilient communities, especially those with higher vulnerability due to socio-economic factors. *(Resilient Los Angeles, Goal 6, Page 32)*

2. **Plant Trees in Communities with Fewer Trees**
   - **Climate Threat:** Increasing heat and poor air quality.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Communities with low tree canopy cover, which tend to be burdened by poor air quality, higher risk of heat- and pollution-related health risks, and lower average household incomes. The goal is to improve the resilience of these vulnerable communities against extreme heat and urban heat islands. *(Resilient Los Angeles, Goal 6, Page 34)*

3. **Transition to Fossil-Fuel-Free Streets**
   - **Climate Threat:** Air pollution and global climate change.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Disadvantaged communities will benefit from the first EV carshare program designed for them, as part of the city's commitment to purchasing only zero-emission buses by 2025 and eliminating emissions in a designated area by 2030. *(Resilient Los Angeles, Goal 12, Page 75)*

4. **Transition to Zero-Emissions Technology at the Port of L.A.**
   - **Climate Threat:** Air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** As a regional source of air pollution, the Port of L.A. impacts surrounding communities, and efforts to leverage clean air investments will improve air quality for these areas. *(Resilient Los Angeles, Goal 12, Page 74)*

5. **Incorporate Sea Level Rise Modeling into Local Plans**
   - **Climate Threat:** Sea level rise and coastal flooding.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Coastal neighborhoods impacted by projected sea level rise, where socio-economic, physical, economic, and ecosystem-focused vulnerabilities will be assessed to inform planning policy. *(Resilient Los Angeles, Goal 12, Page 76)*

Each of these policies not only addresses specific climate threats but also focuses on areas or populations with significant climate vulnerability, thereby advancing climate justice through targeted interventions.

### Question: Is there any climate policy identified in the plan that could be a potential maladaptation? For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided document, I did not find any climate policies that are explicitly identified as potential maladaptations. The document outlines several climate policies aimed at addressing climate threats through resilience, mitigation, and adaptation options. Here are some examples:

1. **Develop an Urban Heat Vulnerability Index and Mitigation Plan**
   - **Climate Threat:** The policy addresses higher temperatures and more frequent extreme heat.
   - **Option Proposed:** The policy proposes developing frameworks for prioritizing neighborhoods, engaging stakeholders, and creating policies to achieve a heat-resilient Los Angeles. This involves identifying funding sources and recommending budgets to support changes *(Appendix A: Summary of Actions by Chapter, Page 157)*.

2. **Transition to Fossil-Fuel-Free Streets**
   - **Climate Threat:** This policy addresses air pollution and the global threat of climate change.
   - **Option Proposed:** The policy focuses on transitioning to zero-emissions technology by purchasing only zero-emission buses by 2025 and eliminating emissions in a designated area by 2030 *(Goal 12: Use Climate Science to Develop Adaptation Strategies, Page 128)*.

3. **Incorporate Sea Level Rise Modeling into Local Plans**
   - **Climate Threat:** The policy addresses the threat of sea level rise and its impacts on coastal planning.
   - **Option Proposed:** The policy suggests incorporating leading science and modeling into planning efforts, including Local Coastal Programs and strategic land use policies *(Goal 12: Use Climate Science to Develop Adaptation Strategies, Page 129)*.

4. **Transition to Zero-Emissions Technology at the Port of L.A.**
   - **Climate Threat:** This policy targets emissions and air quality issues.
   - **Option Proposed:** The policy leverages clean air investments and energy innovations to improve air quality and achieve significant emission reductions *(Goal 12: Use Climate Science to Develop Adaptation Strategies, Page 127)*.

These policies are designed to enhance resilience and adapt to climate threats, focusing on reducing emissions and preparing for climate impacts. None of them are identified as potential maladaptations in the document.

### Question: Summarize the plan's description of how the planning jurisdiction will monitor and evaluate progress on the implementation of resilience options, mitigation options, and adaptation options proposed in the plan.
**Answer:**
The plan outlines a comprehensive approach to monitor and evaluate the progress of resilience, mitigation, and adaptation options through several strategies:

- **Expansion of the Office of Resilience:** The Office of Resilience and the Chief Resilience Officer will lead the implementation of the plan, fostering partnerships and engaging residents in resilience-building actions. This includes integrating resilience-building into departmental strategic planning and measuring citywide resilience metrics *(Prepared and Responsive City, Goal 8, Page 86)*.

- **City Resilience Index:** Los Angeles will pilot the City Resilience Index, which is a comprehensive tool to measure a city's resilience systematically. This tool will help track resilience outcomes, the implementation of actions in the plan, and the institutionalization of resilience within city systems and services over time *(Prepared and Responsive City, Goal 8, Page 87)*.

- **Integration into Performance Reviews:** The implementation of actions in the plan will be incorporated into the annual performance reviews and budget proposals of city departments and General Managers to ensure accountability and alignment with the resilience goals *(Prepared and Responsive City, Goal 8, Page 87)*.

- **Development of New Citywide Equity Indicators:** These indicators will inform and measure inclusive investments and policy-making, ensuring that resilience measures are equitable and effective *(Appendix A: Summary of Actions by Chapter, Goal 8, Action 48, Page 157)*.

These strategies collectively ensure that the city systematically tracks and evaluates the progress of the resilience, mitigation, and adaptation options proposed in the plan.
