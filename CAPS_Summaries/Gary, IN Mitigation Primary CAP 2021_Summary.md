### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
**Resilience:**

The plan addresses resilience through strategies to ensure that the lakeshore is resilient to anticipated changes. It emphasizes the importance of creating climate refugia and enhancing biodiversity to promote resilience. The plan states, "the National Park System is developing strategies to ensure that the lakeshore is resilient to anticipated changes by strengthening certain elements" and mentions creating deeper wetlands as a transition action to help ecosystems respond to climate disturbances (Gary Climate Action Plan).

**Mitigation:**

Mitigation efforts are highlighted through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The plan includes targets such as "50 MW of local renewable energy generation by 2030" and a "35% Community Greenhouse Gas Emissions reduction from 2017 baseline by 2030 (Excluding Industrial Sources)" (Gary Climate Action Plan). The plan also discusses the importance of energy-efficient building codes to reduce emissions from buildings, which generate significant GHG emissions.

**Adaptation:**

Adaptation strategies are evident in the plan's goals to mitigate the urban heat island effect, adapt stormwater management practices, and improve the resilience of regional plants and animals. It includes providing landscape corridors and climate refugia to help species adapt to changing environments (Gary Climate Action Plan).

**Classification:**

Based on the provided summary, the plan can be classified as an **equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan**, as it addresses both mitigation and adaptation strategies in a balanced manner.

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes a scenario of climate change that the Indiana Dunes and surrounding region will face. Key elements of the scenario include:

- **Increased Temperatures and Precipitation:** "The Dunes is projected to have a growing season that is one month longer, hotter summers with 30-45 days above 95 degrees, and wetter winters with 24-36 less days of snow cover." (Gary Climate Action Plan, pg. 39)

- **Phenological Mismatch:** "One important impact is phenological mismatch, or out of sync life cycle associations of organisms... Due to climate change, the triggers for plant’s life cycle events is dependent on soil temperature. But the life cycle events of animals like bird migration are triggered by air temperature changes." (Gary Climate Action Plan, pg. 19)

- **Changes in Hydrology:** "Increased precipitation and decreased snow will result in less ice cover on Lake Michigan. More precipitation will also inundate watersheds and increase runoff and infiltration issues in the Indiana Dunes." (Gary Climate Action Plan)

- **Impact on Biodiversity:** "Longer summers allow invasive species to thrive and take over... Another priority is to ensure that warm-weather plants, which will increase given increasing temperatures, don’t crowd out many of the plants that grow in the Northern forest." (Gary Climate Action Plan, pg. 39)

- **Industrial Impact:** "Regional hydrology and water quality is already stressed by local industry, especially the railroad and steel industry." (Gary Climate Action Plan)

The planning jurisdiction is addressing these challenges through various climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation.

The policy aims to reduce these costs and improve living conditions. *(Chapter 4: Equity and Resilience)*

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the document provided, here are potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies:

1. **Urban Forestry as a Mitigation Strategy**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:**
     - The policy addresses the threat of increased heat impacts due to climate change and the development of urban heat islands.
   
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option Proposed:**

   - **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
     - These green infrastructure solutions may lead to maladaptation if they are not properly maintained or if the chosen plant species for bioswales and rain gardens do not withstand future climate conditions. This could result in infrastructure that fails during extreme weather events, causing increased flooding or water quality issues.

3. **Building Energy Efficiency Upgrades**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:**
     - The policy addresses the need to reduce emissions from buildings and lower energy costs for residents, particularly during extreme temperature events.
