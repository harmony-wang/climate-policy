**Answer:**
Based strictly on the document provided, there are no explicit mentions of climate policies directly aimed at advancing climate justice. The document does not detail specific climate threats or identify areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to any identified climate hazards in relation to climate justice. It does, however, discuss various sustainability and environmental initiatives that might have indirect benefits related to climate justice, but these are not explicitly labeled as such within the document.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided document, the following potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies are identified:

1. **Urban Forestry Plan**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The plan aims to "minimize the urban heat island effect (lower local temperatures)".
   - **Option Proposed:** The plan involves developing an urban forestry plan that includes parking lot standards to protect and expand the city's tree resources.
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** While the intention is to reduce local temperatures, the implementation of parking lot standards could inadvertently lead to increased impermeable surfaces if not carefully managed, potentially exacerbating stormwater runoff issues instead of mitigating them.

2. **Alternate Fuels Strategy for Public and Private Vehicles**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The strategy aims to address reliance on fossil fuels and reduce associated greenhouse gas emissions.
   - **Option Proposed:** Collaborating with local stakeholders to develop an integrated alternate fuels strategy, including maximizing the use of locally derived fuels and developing required alternate fuel infrastructure.

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The programs target water scarcity and inefficient water use.
   - **Option Proposed:** Establishing residential and commercial water efficiency incentive programs to encourage the installation of cost-effective technologies such as efficient plumbing fixtures and smart irrigation controllers.
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** Without proper monitoring and evaluation, these programs might encourage over-investment in water-saving technologies that do not significantly reduce water use or address water consumption behavior changes, potentially leading to a false sense of security regarding water availability.

4. **Sustainability Features Incentives in the Unified Development Ordinance (UDO)**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The UDO aims to promote sustainable development and reduce environmental impact.
   - **Option Proposed:** Offering incentives for sustainable development practices, such as renewable energy installations and LEED Silver certification.
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** If not carefully implemented, the incentives might lead to development patterns that prioritize short-term gains in sustainability metrics over long-term resilience, potentially resulting in developments that are not adaptable to future climate risks or that concentrate resources in certain areas, increasing vulnerability elsewhere.
