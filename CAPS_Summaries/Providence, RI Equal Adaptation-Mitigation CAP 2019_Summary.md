### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
**Resilience:**

- The plan emphasizes creating a network of Resilience Hubs, which are "community-serving facilities augmented to support residents and coordinate resources distribution and services before, during or after a natural hazard event" (Providence’s Climate Justice Plan, 2019, p.57). These hubs aim to enhance community resilience by providing resources and supporting neighborhood revitalization.
- It also calls for the development of "a long-term climate resilience and adaptation plan" focusing on areas vulnerable to climate impacts like heat, flooding, and sea-level rise (Providence’s Climate Justice Plan, 2019, p.35).

**Mitigation:**

- The plan sets a goal for Providence to become "carbon neutral by 2050" (Providence’s Climate Justice Plan, 2019, p.8).
- It emphasizes reducing carbon emissions, especially in communities most affected by pollution, to address both global climate change and local health, racial, and economic disparities (Providence’s Climate Justice Plan, 2019, p.13).

**Adaptation:**

- The plan highlights the need to "examine the impacts of heat, riverine flooding, coastal storms, sea-level rise and other related effects of climate change" as part of its resilience and adaptation strategy (Providence’s Climate Justice Plan, 2019, p.35).
- It underscores an equitable approach in adaptation planning by centering those most impacted by climate change in the decision-making process (Providence’s Climate Justice Plan, 2019, p.35).

**Classification:**

The plan can be classified as an **equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan** because it places significant emphasis on both reducing GHG emissions (mitigation) and enhancing community resilience and adaptation to climate impacts, while ensuring equitable processes and outcomes.

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes the scenario of climate change that Providence is preparing for as part of its climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation. 

- The plan acknowledges that people of color in Providence are disproportionately burdened by the polluting industries causing climate change and are most exposed to its impacts, such as extreme heat and flooding. *"In Providence and around the world, people of color have contributed the least to the climate crisis yet they are disproportionately burdened by the polluting industries that are causing climate change and other environmental degradation. They are also most exposed to the impacts of climate change, like extreme heat and flooding."* (Climate Justice)

- The plan aims to transition the city away from fossil fuels in a just and equitable manner, addressing root causes like structural racism and economic inequality. *"This plan, which was co-created by the Office of Sustainability and the Racial and Environmental Justice Committee (REJC), tackles climate change by addressing the root causes: structural racism, economic inequality, and our extractive economy."* (The Opportunity)

- Moreover, the plan includes a focus on carbon reduction in communities most affected by co-pollutants and areas with sensitive populations, addressing both global climate issues and local health, racial, and economic disparities. *"By focusing carbon reduction at the source in communities most affected by co-pollutants and in areas with more sensitive populations (ex. children, people with asthma), climate action not only addresses the global problem, but it also addresses health, racial and economic disparities."* (Climate Justice)

These scenarios highlight the challenges Providence faces due to climate change and outline the areas where the city is planning to implement climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided document, there are no explicit mentions of specific climate policies identified as causing potential unforeseen maladaptation. The plan emphasizes equitable and just climate action, prioritizing frontline communities and ensuring that the policies do not shift the burden of climate impacts onto others. However, I can outline some general considerations based on the content provided:

### **1. General Considerations for Potential Maladaptation:**

#### **Policy: Zoning and Land Use Changes**

- **Climate Threat:** Pollution and community health impacts from industrial land uses.
- **Option Proposed:** Explore zoning and land use policy changes to reduce pollution and improve community health. This includes updating the zoning ordinance to prohibit new fossil fuel infrastructure and address cumulative health impacts.
- **Potential Maladaptation:** While these changes aim to improve health outcomes, there is a risk that strict zoning updates might inadvertently limit economic opportunities or increase housing prices, potentially displacing communities they aim to protect. 

#### **Policy: Resilience Hubs Creation**

- **Climate Threat:** Natural hazards and climate impacts on vulnerable communities.
- **Option Proposed:** Establishing Resilience Hubs to support residents and coordinate resource distribution before, during, or after a natural hazard event.
- **Potential Maladaptation:** If not managed inclusively, these hubs might not fully address the needs of all community members, particularly if they are not accessible to everyone or if management does not reflect community diversity. There is also a risk that reliance on such hubs could detract from broader systemic improvements to resilience infrastructure.

#### **Policy: Carbon Neutral Initiatives**

- **Climate Threat:** Greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change.
- **Option Proposed:** Achieving carbon neutrality by calculating total emissions, reducing them, and balancing remaining emissions, often through offsets like tree planting or investing in green technologies.
- **Potential Maladaptation:** Carbon offsetting, if not implemented with social equity in mind, might shift the burden of emissions elsewhere rather than reducing local emissions. This could result in communities facing ongoing local pollution while offsets are achieved in other regions.

### **Conclusion:**

While none of these policies are explicitly identified as maladaptive in the document, they highlight the importance of careful implementation and ongoing community engagement to ensure that well-intentioned climate policies do not inadvertently lead to maladaptation or exacerbate existing inequities.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option?

| **Threats Identified**  | - Methane emissions from gas leaks: "Gas leaks not only result in methane being released into the air, which is one of the most potent forms of climate pollution, but they are also harmful to human health, present a serious public safety threat, and result in the premature death of street trees." (Community Health)  <br>- Climate change impacts such as heat, riverine flooding, coastal storms, sea-level rise. (Collaborative Governance and Accountability)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Measures Identified** | - Advocate for legislation to eliminate gas leaks and repair during road construction: "The state should consider a law that prohibits National Grid from passing the cost of wasted gas onto consumers... The state should also consider a law requiring National Grid to repair gas leaks during road construction projects." (Community Health) <br>- Create a network of Resilience Hubs: "Resilience Hubs are defined as: 'Community-serving facilities augmented to support residents and coordinate resources distribution and services before, during or after a natural hazard event.'" (Resilience Hubs) <br>- Develop a long-term climate resilience and adaptation plan: "Partner with the REJC and other frontline communities to ensure those most impacted by the impacts of climate change are centered in the process of designing and implementing a plan..."
