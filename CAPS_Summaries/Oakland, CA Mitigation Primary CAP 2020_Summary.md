### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
**Resilience:**

The plan emphasizes resilience by prioritizing actions and strategies that "leave flexibility to accommodate technological, political, and cultural shifts over the Plan’s 10-year implementation period." It focuses on building resilience in frontline communities, highlighting the importance of addressing immediate and foreseeable climate risks, especially to health and safety. The plan includes actions such as "Fund Creation and Operation of Resilience Hubs" and "Enhance Community Energy Resilience," which aim to protect frontline communities and integrate adaptation with community engagement (ADAPTATION).

**Mitigation:**

The plan addresses mitigation by setting a goal to "identify an equitable path toward cost-effectively reducing Oakland’s local climate emissions a minimum of 56%," transitioning away from fossil fuel dependence, and reducing lifecycle emissions. It includes strategies like "Reduce Emissions from Port Vehicles and Equipment," "Accelerate City Fleet Vehicle Replacement," and "Phase Out Fossil Fuel Dependency in All City Agreements and Contracts" (LIST OF ACTIONS).

**Adaptation:**

Adaptation is a key component of the plan, with actions such as "Fund and Implement Citywide Vulnerability Assessment and Comprehensive Adaptation Plan" and "Wildfire Risk Reduction." The plan highlights the need for a comprehensive adaptation plan to address neighborhood-level risks and maximize public resources, especially for disproportionately impacted communities. It stresses the importance of centering equity in adaptation efforts and co-creating solutions with frontline communities (ADAPTATION).

**Classification:**

The plan can be classified as an **equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan**. It places significant emphasis on both reducing GHG emissions and enhancing resilience and adaptation strategies to address climate impacts.

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes a scenario of climate change that the planning jurisdiction, Oakland, will face. It highlights the ongoing and future impacts of climate change despite any immediate cessation of global GHG emissions. The scenario includes:

- **Sea Level Rise and Wildfires:** "Even if global GHG emissions ended tomorrow, Oakland would still be impacted by climate change. Carbon in the atmosphere will continue to influence sea level rise, wildfires, and other threats." (*ADAPTATION*)

- **Increased Risks Over Time:** "The longer it takes to eliminate human-caused carbon emissions, the more those risks will increase." (*ADAPTATION*)

- **Vulnerability of Frontline Communities:** "Frontline communities feel the impacts of climate change first and worst, a trend that will be amplified without corrective and protective action." (*ADAPTATION*)

The plan emphasizes the importance of resilience and adaptation measures to address these imminent threats, particularly in disproportionately impacted communities.

### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan outlines several climate policies aimed at advancing climate justice. Here's a summary of each policy, including the climate threat it addresses and the areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability:

1. **Prioritizing Frontline Communities**
   - **Climate Threat:** The plan addresses a variety of climate threats, including sea level rise, industrial pollution, and extreme heat.
   - **Vulnerable Populations:** "Frontline communities" are defined as those who have been and will continue to be hit first and worst by the impacts of environmental injustice and the climate crisis. These include communities facing intersecting vulnerabilities, such as racial discrimination, poverty, disability, and housing insecurity. Specifically, in Oakland, these communities are often located in the flatlands and the Interstate 880 corridor, where there is the worst air and soil pollution, traffic congestion, and diesel particulate exposure. (*LEADING WITH EQUITY*)

2. **Equitable Implementation**
   - **Climate Threat:** This policy addresses the broader impacts of climate change, including social and economic disparities exacerbated by climate impacts.
   - **Vulnerable Populations:** The plan emphasizes ensuring equitable outcomes for "frontline communities," which are those with high social vulnerability and high climate impacts. The City uses tools like CalEnviroScreen 3.0 and the Oakland Equity Indicators Report to identify these communities, which often include areas with poor air quality, high poverty levels, and other socioeconomic disadvantages. (*Equitable Implementation*)

3. **Citywide Vulnerability Assessment and Comprehensive Adaptation Plan**
   - **Climate Threat:** The policy focuses on various climate risks, including those posed by climate emergency events.
   - **Vulnerable Populations:** Resources and efforts will prioritize "frontline communities" that are at greater risk, such as those identified in the citywide vulnerability assessment. These include populations in areas with high exposure to climate hazards and those who are least able to adapt, resist, or recover from climate impacts. (*ADAPTATION*)

4. **The Climate Emergency and Just Transition Resolution**
   - **Climate Threat:** This resolution addresses the urgency of global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and resilience against intensifying climate impacts.
   - **Vulnerable Populations:** The resolution calls for a focus on "frontline communities" who are most exposed to climate change impacts, including low-income communities and communities of color. These populations face the greatest risks from climate-related disasters and socio-economic disadvantages. (*INTRODUCTION*)

By addressing these threats and focusing on vulnerable populations, the plan aims to reduce disparate harms and ensure that the benefits of climate actions accrue first to those hardest hit by social and economic injustices.
