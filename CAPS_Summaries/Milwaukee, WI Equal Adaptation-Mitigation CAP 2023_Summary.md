**Answer:**
### Resilience

The plan addresses resilience by emphasizing strategies that prepare residents and businesses for climate change. It includes initiatives like the **"ECO Neighborhoods Initiative"** which involves regular communication with residents about available programs. The plan also mentions the role of **"Resilience Ambassadors"** who connect communities with tools and resources to enhance resilience against climate change impacts such as **"extreme storms and heat waves"** (City Strategy). Furthermore, resilience is a core component of the **"10 Big Ideas"** outlined in the plan, with a focus on **"Protect and Restore Nature in the City"**, which involves nature-based solutions to absorb stormwater and reduce the urban heat island effect (Importance).

### Mitigation

The plan includes significant mitigation efforts aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It outlines goals to **"reduce community greenhouse gas emissions 45% by 2030"** and **"achieve net-zero emissions by 2050"** (Executive Summary). Strategies include the promotion of renewable energy projects, energy efficiency retrofits, and transitioning the electric grid to carbon-free sources (Summary of the 10 Big Ideas).

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based strictly on the content provided in the document, there are no explicit mentions of specific unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. The document focuses on climate resilience, mitigation, and adaptation options that aim to address climate threats effectively. However, potential for maladaptation can be inferred from the context of certain policies. Here's one such inferred example:

### Policy: Transitioning from Coal to Natural Gas

1. **The Climate Threat it is Addressing:**
   - The policy aims to address air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to high rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses. This is connected to the broader threat of climate change due to fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation.

2. **The Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:**
   - **Mitigation Option:** "In the short term, Milwaukee can switch from coal-fired power plants to natural gas to reduce air pollution."

3. **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
   - While switching from coal to natural gas may reduce certain pollutants and lower carbon emissions compared to coal, it may cause inadvertent maladaptation by:
     - **Locking in Infrastructure:** Investing in natural gas infrastructure could lock in fossil fuel reliance, delaying the transition to renewable energy sources.
     - **Methane Emissions:** Natural gas is primarily methane, a potent greenhouse gas, which can leak during extraction and distribution, potentially offsetting some of the climate benefits.
     - **Short-term Focus:** The focus on a short-term solution might detract from longer-term, more sustainable strategies such as investing directly in renewable energy sources.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.
