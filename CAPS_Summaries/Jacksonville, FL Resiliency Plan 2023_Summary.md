### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
**Resilience:**

The plan emphasizes resilience by outlining strategies to cope with climate hazards and maintain essential functions. It includes actions that focus on **"residents, communities, businesses, organizations, and partnerships"** to ensure **"shared prosperity for Jacksonville’s people and businesses for the long-term"** (PEOPLE). The plan also details **"Resilience Approaches and Actions that work across multiple sites at a neighborhood, corridor, landscape, or regional scale"** to guide **"safe and connected development to areas of low flood risk and high resilience potential"** (SYSTEMS).

**Mitigation:**

The plan includes mitigation actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For example, it mentions the development of a Climate Action Plan to **"inventory the Jacksonville region’s greenhouse gas emissions, develop priority actions to reduce them, and engage with community stakeholders on continued implementation of climate mitigation actions"** (ADAPTATION ACTIONS | PEOPLE RESILIENT JACKSONVILLE). This includes actions like **"retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency"** to reduce emissions (ADAPTATION ACTIONS | PEOPLE RESILIENT JACKSONVILLE).

**Adaptation:**

Adaptation is a core component of the plan, with a focus on adjusting systems to the expected climate changes. It includes **"45 Actions and 90 Sub-Actions organized by the scales at which the actions are intended to be implemented—Systems, Sites, and People"** (ADAPTATION ACTIONS RESILIENT JACKSONVILLE). The plan addresses **"multiple shocks and stressors, account for people and systems as well as sites, and are geared toward shaping a resilient future for the city"** (RESILIENT JACKSONVILLE).

**Classification:**

The plan can be classified as an **adaptation/resilience dedicated** plan. It places a significant emphasis on developing resilience strategies and adaptation actions across various scales while also addressing some aspects of mitigation. However, the primary focus is on building resilience and adapting to climate impacts.

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes several scenarios related to climate change that the planning jurisdiction, Jacksonville, will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation.

### **Scenario of Future Growth Patterns:**

- **Suburban Growth Continuation:** If recent development patterns continue, more than 85% of Jacksonville’s population growth over the last 20 years has been in Contemporary Suburbs. This could lead to the expansion of suburbs from approximately 39% of the land area to more than 78%, requiring significant investment in infrastructure and potentially increasing vulnerability to flooding and other climate threats. The plan emphasizes the need for deliberate action to focus expansion away from higher-risk areas. (*Scenarios for Citywide Adaptation*).

- **Urban Core Focus:** An alternative scenario considers focusing growth in the urban core, which currently has a population density between about 2,000 (Downtown) and 3,000 people per square mile (Historic Walkable Neighborhoods). By accommodating half of the projected growth (approximately 340,000 people), the population density could increase by 6.5 times, preserving more undeveloped land and reducing suburban sprawl. This would require revitalizing underutilized spaces such as vacant properties and parking lots. (*Scenarios for Citywide Adaptation*).

### **Climate Change Impacts:**

- The plan emphasizes that the Earth’s climate is changing faster than at any point in modern history, with significant impacts anticipated from rising sea levels and increased extreme weather events due to temperature increases. The need for substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions is highlighted to limit temperature increases and mitigate these impacts. (*Evolving Challenges Require New Approaches*).

### **Risks and Vulnerabilities:**

- A geographic assessment was conducted to understand risks and vulnerabilities from climate threats such as flooding, heat, high winds, and wildfires, especially how these overlap with social stressors like poverty and food insecurity. (*Evolving Challenges Require New Approaches*).

### **Climate Actions:**

- The strategy includes developing a Climate Action Plan that aligns Jacksonville’s resilience goals with actions to promote sustainability, addressing large-scale contributors to climate change, such as greenhouse gas emissions. (*Adaptation Actions | People*).

These scenarios and assessments are part of Jacksonville's strategic approach to guide future growth and resilience efforts comprehensively, addressing both immediate and long-term climate challenges.

### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan identifies the following climate policies to advance climate justice:

1. **Cooling Strategies and Urban Heat Islands**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Extreme heat and urban heat islands.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** The plan states that "lower-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately exposed to urban heat islands" due to historic discriminatory housing practices such as redlining. These communities "are more likely to live in areas with fewer trees and more pavement than Whiter and wealthier communities" (*Urban Heat Islands & Equity*).

2. **Equitable Cooling Investments**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Extreme heat.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** The plan highlights that as Jacksonville works to advance cooling strategies, an "equitable approach that prioritizes investments in historically marginalized communities can begin to reduce these disparities in urban heat islands" (*Urban Heat Islands & Equity*).

3. **JaxReady Alert System Expansion**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Extreme heat.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** The plan targets populations "identified as vulnerable to heat such as older adults, young children, people who work or play sports outside, and lower income households" by expanding the JaxReady alert system to provide information during extreme heat events (*Strengthen the citywide response to extreme heat and other public health emergencies*).

These policies focus on addressing the disproportionate impacts of climate threats on vulnerable communities and aim to provide more equitable climate resilience solutions.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided document, the following potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies have been identified:

1. **Urban Tree Planting and Maintenance**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Urban Heat Island Effect and Stormwater Management.
   
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option Proposed:** "Plant more climate-adaptive trees to increase shade and ecosystem value" and develop an "Urban Forest Management Plan" to ensure long-term community benefits (Adaptation Actions | Systems).
   
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** While planting climate-adaptive trees is beneficial, the selection of inappropriate species or monocultures could lead to increased vulnerability if they are not resilient to all projected climate conditions, such as high winds or saltwater flooding. Additionally, without proper maintenance and diversity, the urban forest could suffer from pest infestations or diseases, reducing its effectiveness in providing resilience against urban heat and stormwater management.

2. **Fortification of Critical Infrastructure**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Flooding, High Winds, and Extreme Heat.
   
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option Proposed:** "Fortify City-owned assets, such as evacuation roads and bridges" to ensure continuity of operations (Adaptation Actions | Sites).
   
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** Fortifying infrastructure can be expensive and might prioritize hardening over other adaptive measures like relocation or redesign. This could lead to increased vulnerability if the fortified infrastructure fails under extreme conditions, or if resources are diverted from more flexible or sustainable solutions that could provide broader resilience benefits.

3. **Infill Development in Low-Risk Areas**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Flood Risks.
   
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option Proposed:** "Facilitate strategic infill development in areas of low flood risk" to encourage development that is resilient to increasing climate impacts (Adaptation Actions | Systems).
   
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** Encouraging development in low-risk areas without considering future climate projections could inadvertently increase vulnerability if those areas become riskier due to changing climate patterns. Additionally, increased density might strain existing infrastructure or ecosystems, potentially exacerbating other climate-related issues such as heat or water scarcity.

These policies are well-intentioned but require careful implementation and ongoing assessment to avoid unintended consequences that might increase climate vulnerability.
