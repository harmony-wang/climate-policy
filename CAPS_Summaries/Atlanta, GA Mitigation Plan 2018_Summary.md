**Answer:**
Based on the provided document, the following potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies can be identified:

1. **Policy: "Achieve 100% clean energy targets by purchasing renewable energy credits (RECs)"**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy addresses the threat of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change.
   
   - **Option Proposed:** The policy proposes using renewable energy credits as a mitigation option to achieve 100% clean energy targets.
   
   - **Reason for Maladaptation:** While purchasing RECs helps in achieving clean energy targets, it may cause inadvertent maladaptation by potentially diverting resources and attention away from local energy efficiency improvements and in-state renewable generation, as highlighted in the plan: "There are concerns among city leadership that achieving these goals within the 2025/2035 timeframes under current state and federal policy would result in the City simply purchasing large amounts of renewable energy credits rather than achieving the goal through energy efficiency and in-state renewable generation." This approach might not contribute to local resilience or adaptation efforts, and it may not reduce local air pollution or create local jobs in renewable energy infrastructure.

2. **Policy: "Implement the 'Round-It-Up' energy efficiency programs"**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy addresses the threat of high energy burdens and inefficiencies in energy use.
   
   - **Option Proposed:** The policy proposes energy efficiency improvements as a resilience option by funding through rounding up electricity bills to the nearest dollar.
   
   - **Reason for Maladaptation:** The plan mentions that "under business as usual conditions... 800,000 to 1.2 million Atlantans may find themselves living with electricity burdens that exceed the national average in 2035." If not designed carefully, the 'Round-It-Up' program could inadvertently increase financial burdens on low-income households, especially if they are unable to opt-out or if the benefits from the collected funds are not equitably distributed.

These policies should be designed with careful consideration of potential impacts to avoid exacerbating vulnerabilities or creating new challenges in the community.
