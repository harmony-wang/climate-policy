### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan does not explicitly mention climate justice or specific policies targeted at advancing climate justice. However, several policies indirectly contribute to equitable climate resilience and adaptation, which can be inferred to support climate justice. Here's a summary of the relevant policies:

1. **Policy: Increase Tree Canopy and Protect Air Quality**

   - **Climate Threat:** Air pollution and carbon emissions.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Areas lacking green spaces, which are likely to be in more densely populated or economically disadvantaged parts of the city. Increasing tree canopy can provide cleaner air and more shaded areas, benefiting vulnerable populations that are often located in urban heat islands.

   > "Increase tree canopy by 30% by 2030 – City Commission in 2009 passed Resolution number 3218 to increase tree canopy by 30% within the City." (Goal 1.2)

2. **Policy: Support Mobility and Alternative Transportation**

   - **Climate Threat:** Dependence on fossil fuels and associated emissions.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Populations with limited access to personal vehicles, including low-income families and individuals relying on public transportation. Enhancing alternative transportation options can reduce emissions and provide equitable access to transportation.

   > "Encourage shelter and shade at bus stops without coverage. Continue to monitor and assess the City bus network to ensure coverage, identify gaps and modify routes as appropriate." (Goal 3.4)

3. **Policy: Community Outreach and Empowerment**

   - **Climate Threat:** Lack of awareness and preparedness for climate impacts.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Communities with less access to information or resources to prepare for climate changes. Engagement and empowerment can increase resilience among those who might otherwise be left out of climate adaptation efforts.

   > "Foster partnerships with active community members, homeowners associations, local non-profits, colleges and universities and businesses to convey information, outreach and empowerment." (Goal 5.1)

4. **Policy: Encourage Green Development and Resiliency**

   - **Climate Threat:** Urban heat and inefficient energy use.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Urban areas with high impervious surfaces and low green spaces, often impacting lower-income communities disproportionately. Green development can help reduce urban heat effects and energy costs.

   > "Continue adopting policies that encourage and promote Green Development and resiliency." (Goal 3.1)

These policies indicate an effort to address climate threats in a way that could potentially benefit vulnerable populations, though they are not explicitly labeled as climate justice initiatives.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based strictly on the content provided, no specific maladaptive climate policies were directly identified in the plan. The document outlines various policies and initiatives aimed at addressing climate threats through resilience, mitigation, and adaptation options. However, I can highlight some areas where potential maladaptations could arise if not carefully managed:

1. **Encouragement of Green Roofs and Living Walls**  
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Heat island effect and greenhouse gas emissions.
   - **Resilience/Mitigation/Adaptation Option:** Allowing green roofs and living walls to reduce energy use, improve water quality, and reduce air pollution (Chapter 3).
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** If not properly designed or maintained, green roofs and living walls could lead to increased maintenance costs or structural issues, potentially causing economic strain or reduced building resilience.

2. **Promotion of Renewable Energy Credits and Systems**  
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** High energy consumption and GHG emissions.
   - **Resilience/Mitigation/Adaptation Option:** Encouraging the purchase of renewable energy credits and installation of renewable energy systems like solar panels (Objective 2.3.1).
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** Reliance on renewable energy credits without local renewable energy production might lead to a false sense of sustainability. This could delay the adoption of more effective local renewable energy solutions.

3. **Encouragement of Low VOCs in Construction**  
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Air pollution and health impacts.
   - **Resilience/Mitigation/Adaptation Option:** Encourage the use of low volatile organic compounds in sealants, paints, and adhesives (Chapter 3).
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** If alternative products with low VOCs are not carefully selected, they might have other environmental or health impacts, negating the intended benefits.

These examples highlight the importance of comprehensive planning and continuous evaluation to ensure that well-intentioned climate policies do not inadvertently lead to maladaptation.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts.
