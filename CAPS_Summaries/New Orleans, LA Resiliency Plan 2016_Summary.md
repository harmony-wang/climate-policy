### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
**Resilience:**

The Main Street Resilience Plan primarily focuses on resilience by targeting long-term economic and physical recovery. It identifies areas of greatest vulnerability within Main Street commercial corridors and aims to develop a shared definition of resilient commercial corridors for New Orleans. The plan includes a methodology for assessing resilience and provides individualized recommendations for improving resilience across different corridors. It also emphasizes the importance of building resilience through infrastructure improvements and policy changes, as evident in initiatives like the Resilient New Orleans strategy and the Resilient Commercial Buildings Program. 

- "*Develop a shared definition of resilient commercial corridors for New Orleans based on the extensive work at national and local levels*" (Chapter 2).
- "*Create a measurable and actionable methodology for assessing the resilience of commercial corridors*" (Chapter 2).
- "*Develop how-to guides for business owners to improve the resilience of business operations and for businesses and property owners to improve building resilience*" (Chapter 2).

**Mitigation:**

The plan includes some elements of mitigation, particularly through the improvement of stormwater infrastructure and the promotion of building hardening to withstand climate impacts. However, these actions are more focused on reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience rather than directly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

- "*The impacts of storm events may be reduced by increasing the permeability of existing paving and other hard surfaces*" (Stormwater Resilience Enhancements).
- "*Resiliency improvements for buildings should aim to protect major systems, such as HVAC, electrical, and plumbing...*" (Resilient Commercial Buildings Program).

**Adaptation:**

Adaptation is addressed through strategies to adjust systems to withstand actual or expected climate changes. This includes improvements in stormwater management and building retrofits to minimize harm from climate impacts.

- "*Small-scale improvements may be implemented to incrementally improve the overall condition and functioning of the city’s stormwater infrastructure*" (Stormwater Resilience Enhancements).
- "*Resilient building retrofits can be part of an historic preservation strategy, while new development or major renovations should consider balancing any elevation of structures with the site, streetscape, and nearby architecture*" (Resilient Commercial Buildings Program).

**Classification:**

The plan can be classified as an **adaptation/resilience dedicated plan**. The primary focus is on building resilience and adapting Main Streets and their infrastructure to withstand climate impacts, rather than on mitigation efforts like reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the content provided in the plan, here are potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies:

### Policy: Increasing Permeability of Hard Surfaces

1. **Climate Threat Addressed:**
   - This policy addresses the threat of flooding from storm events, as described in the section titled "Stormwater Resilience Enhancements."

2. **Resilience Option Proposed:**
   - The policy proposes "increasing the permeability of existing paving and other hard surfaces" and performing "detailed hydraulic modeling" to reduce the impacts of storm events.

3. **Potential Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
   - While increasing permeability can reduce surface runoff, if not properly implemented, it may inadvertently lead to insufficient drainage in certain areas, potentially causing localized flooding. Additionally, if the materials used for permeability are not suitable for the local environment, it could result in degradation and increased maintenance costs.

### Policy: Directly Connected Downspouts

1. **Climate Threat Addressed:**
   - This policy is concerned with managing stormwater runoff and preventing flooding, as discussed in the context of building runoff handling.

2. **Adaptation Option Proposed:**
   - The policy suggests using "bioswales and retention facilities" to handle building runoff more sustainably, rather than having directly-connected downspouts.

3. **Potential Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
   - If bioswales and retention facilities are not adequately designed or maintained, they may not effectively manage the volume of runoff during heavy rain events, leading to overflow and potential flooding. Poorly designed systems can also create waterlogging in specific areas, causing damage to infrastructure and increasing vulnerability.

### Policy: Redesigning Excess Pavement for Stormwater Management

1. **Climate Threat Addressed:**
   - This policy aims to address stormwater runoff and flooding issues, as mentioned in the recommendations for the corridor's design.

2. **Resilience Option Proposed:**
   - The plan recommends "redesigning excess pavement in street to aid in storm water management" by converting paved areas into green infrastructure adaptations.

3. **Potential Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
   - If the redesign does not consider the full hydrological context, it might lead to unintended water accumulation in other parts of the community, exacerbating flooding risks elsewhere. Moreover, the removal of pavement without adequate planning might disrupt existing transportation and accessibility, leading to economic and social stresses.


### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.
**Answer:**
The provided document does not specify metrics for measuring the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option in terms of reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Similarly, it does not outline concrete goals or targets with deadlines or specific numerical objectives for these options.

However, the document does discuss various metrics and indicators used for assessing resilience and vulnerability, primarily in the context of commercial corridors. Some of these indicators include:

- **Flooding & Drainage Indicators:**
  - *Max Predicted flood depth (ft)*: Average maximum predicted flood depth using the City of New Orleans Department of Public Works hydraulic model in feet above the manhole rim.
  - *NFIP claims per acre of 0.25 mi. buffer*: National Flood Insurance Program flood claims per acre within 1/4 mile of each corridor.

- **Preparedness Indicators:**
  - *Business Emergency Preparedness Plan*: Percentage of businesses with written plans for evacuation.
  - *Businesses with backup power systems*: Percentage of businesses reporting a generator or similar backup power system.

- **Market Conditions Indicators:**
  - *% Population Change, 2010-2015*: Comparison of 2010 and 2015 population within 1/4 mile of each corridor.
  - *Change in Residential Price per sqft, 2009-2014*: Comparison of 2009 home sale price per square foot to 2014 home sale price per square foot within 1/4 mile of each corridor.

- **Infrastructure and Building Conditions Indicators:**
  - *Catch basins in less than average condition*: Percentage of catch basins along the corridor that are in below-average or worse condition.

While these indicators are used to assess current conditions and vulnerabilities, they do not explicitly measure the success or failure of specific adaptation, resilience, or mitigation options directly in terms of CO2 emissions or air quality improvements. The document focuses more on assessing vulnerabilities and identifying areas for resilience improvement rather than setting specific quantifiable targets or deadlines.
