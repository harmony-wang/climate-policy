   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** The plan mentions impacts on human health, particularly affecting those susceptible to "heat-related illness" and "ground-level ozone" increases, as well as the economic impacts on the insurance and tourism industries (Introduction).

While not directly labeled as "climate justice" policies, these strategies indicate a recognition of the need to address vulnerabilities among different populations and areas, implicitly supporting climate justice goals by aiming to protect those most at risk.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
**1. Climate Policy: Development of Parking Strategies**

- **Climate Threat it is Addressing:**
  - The policy aims to address the urban heat island effect and environmental impacts of transportation, which contribute to climate change.
  
- **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option Proposed:**
  - **Mitigation Option:** The policy proposes to develop sustainable parking strategies, such as shared parking, "park once" districts, and shared vehicle systems, to reduce the reliance on single-occupancy vehicles and minimize environmental impacts.

- **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaption:**
  - While promoting sustainable transportation can reduce emissions, the focus on parking strategies may inadvertently encourage increased urban development and densification. This can lead to greater congestion and potentially increase emissions from vehicles if public transport infrastructure is not adequately improved. Additionally, multi-level parking structures, even with green roofs, could contribute to increased urban density, which might exacerbate the urban heat island effect rather than mitigating it.

**2. Climate Policy: Cool Roofs & Pavements**

- **Climate Threat it is Addressing:**
  - The policy is intended to mitigate the urban heat island effect and reduce energy consumption in buildings.

- **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option Proposed:**
  - **Mitigation Option:** The use of green roofs, rooftop gardens, and light-colored, reflective roofing and pavements for new construction on city property.

- **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaption:**
  - While these measures can reduce heat absorption and decrease cooling energy demands, they may inadvertently increase water runoff and reduce groundwater recharge if not coupled with adequate stormwater management systems. The focus on reflective surfaces might also lead to increased glare and discomfort in urban settings, potentially requiring additional adaptations such as more shading structures or adjustments in urban design.

**3. Climate Policy: Sea Level Rise Adaptation Plan**

- **Climate Threat it is Addressing:**
  - This policy addresses the threat of sea level rise and associated impacts such as increased flooding, saltwater intrusion, and coastal erosion.

- **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option Proposed:**
  - **Adaptation Option:** Establishing a commission to create a comprehensive sea level rise adaptation plan, identifying potential impacts and policy options for various systems within the city.

- **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaption:**
  - The focus on creating a comprehensive plan might lead to an overemphasis on large-scale infrastructure projects, which can be costly and may divert resources away from more immediate and flexible adaptation measures. Additionally, if the plan does not adequately consider future climate variability and socio-economic changes, it may lock the city into maladaptive paths that are not resilient to unforeseen climate impacts or shifts in demographic patterns.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.
**Answer:**
**The plan measures success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option using the following metrics:**

- **Emissions Reductions:** 
  - The plan aims for an emissions reduction goal of 1,104,316 tons of CO₂e by 2030, representing 99% of the benchmark goal of 1,120,000 tons of CO₂e. This is measured in metric tons of CO₂ equivalents (mtCO₂e). 
  - Specific reductions are targeted for various sectors:
    - **Transportation Choices:** A reduction of 152,940 tons of CO₂e in 2030 by maintaining 2010 vehicle miles traveled (VMT) levels. 
    - **Fuel Efficiency:** A reduction of 202,577 tons of CO₂e in 2030 by increasing vehicle fuel efficiency by 30%.
    - **Architecture 2030:** A reduction of 10,770 tons of CO₂e from new city construction and 127,448 tons of CO₂e from encouraging 25% of new construction to follow Architecture 2030 Challenge guidelines.
    - **Home Weatherization:** A reduction of 160,546 tons of CO₂e in 2030 through a program achieving a 50% reduction in energy usage.
    - **Waste Reduction:** A reduction of 22,860 tons of CO₂e in 2030 by reducing the waste stream by 50%.
    - **Renewable Energy:** A reduction of 427,175 tons of CO₂e by replacing 30% of community energy usage with renewable sources.

- **Concrete Goals and Targets:**
  - **2030 Goal:** Achieve a 30% reduction below 2002 emissions levels. This midterm target allows for reevaluation to ensure progress toward the 2050 goal.
  - **2050 Goal:** Achieve an 83% reduction in overall emissions from 2002 levels.
  - The plan’s key recommendations are projected to produce roughly 99% of the reduction needed to meet the 2030 target, with advancements in technology expected to help achieve 100%.

**Units and Metrics Used:**
- **mtCO₂e (metric tons of CO₂ equivalents):** Used for all measurements to standardize comparisons across different activities.
- **Percentage Reductions:** Goals are expressed as percentage reductions from baseline years (e.g., 30% reduction by 2030 and 83% by 2050).

**Additional Metrics:**
- **Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT):** Targeted to remain at 2010 levels to contribute to transportation-related emissions reductions.
- **Fuel Efficiency Improvement:** Target of a 30% increase in vehicle fuel efficiency.

The plan emphasizes that achieving these reductions requires comprehensive implementation, education, and understanding across all sectors.
