### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes scenarios of climate change that the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation.

### **Scenario Overview**

- **Population Growth and Development Patterns:** 
  - "If population trends continue, Jacksonville will see more than 685,000 additional residents by 2070, increasing the total population to upwards of 1.6 million." The plan considers the impact of different development patterns on climate risks, highlighting that continued expansion into rural areas would result in "Contemporary Suburbs" dominating the landscape, requiring "significant investment in new roads and other infrastructure," and increasing vulnerability to climate threats (see the Evolving Challenges chapter).

- **Urban Core Focus:**
  - Another scenario explores focusing growth in the urban core, which currently has a lower density. This scenario suggests that moving 50% of new residents to the urban core could increase the population density significantly, potentially preserving "more than 200 square miles of undeveloped land in the Rural Mosaic."

- **Climate Change Impacts:** 
  - The plan states that "the Earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, resulting in widespread and growing impacts." Without significant GHG mitigation, temperature increases could be as high as 9°F (5°C) by the end of the century, leading to "rising sea levels and increased extreme weather events."

- **Risks and Vulnerabilities:** 
  - The plan includes a geographic assessment of risks and vulnerabilities associated with four climate threats—flooding, heat, high winds, and wildfires. It also evaluates how these threats overlap with social stressors like poverty and food insecurity.

These scenarios guide the planning jurisdiction in developing climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation, focusing on strategic infill development, updating land development regulations, and ensuring climate action plans align with resilience goals.

### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan identifies several climate policies to advance climate justice. Here are the details:

1. **Urban Heat Islands & Equity**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Extreme heat and urban heat islands.
   - **Areas or Populations with Most Climate Vulnerability:** The plan highlights that lower-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately exposed to urban heat islands. This is due to historic discriminatory housing and land use practices, such as redlining, which resulted in these communities having fewer trees and more pavement compared to wealthier and predominantly White neighborhoods. *"Research across hundreds of U.S. cities shows that lower-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately exposed to urban heat islands."* (Extreme Heat)

2. **Cooling Strategies in Historically Marginalized Communities**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Extreme heat.
   - **Areas or Populations with Most Climate Vulnerability:** The plan emphasizes an equitable approach that prioritizes investments in historically marginalized communities to reduce disparities in urban heat islands. It notes that historically redlined communities were found to be significantly hotter than other areas. *"As Jacksonville works to advance cooling strategies like planting more trees, an equitable approach that prioritizes investments in historically marginalized communities can begin to reduce these disparities in urban heat islands."* (Extreme Heat)

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
**1. Climate Policy: Fortify City-owned assets, such as evacuation roads and bridges.**

- **Climate Threat Addressed:**
  - The policy is addressing multiple climate threats including high wind events, storm surge, and extreme heat events. These threats could potentially compromise critical infrastructure such as evacuation roads and bridges.

- **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:**
  - The policy proposes fortifying city-owned assets as a resilience option to mitigate damage from hazards and ensure continuity of operations. This includes measures such as flood-proofing, elevating, or other hardening methods.

- **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
  - Fortification of infrastructure can be expensive and time-consuming, and if not prioritized correctly, it may divert resources from other essential resilience measures. This focus on hardening infrastructure could lead to neglecting softer, more adaptive approaches that might be more effective in the long term. Additionally, if fortification measures are not based on the best available data and fail to consider the full range of future climate conditions, they may not provide the intended protection, leading to maladaptation.

**2. Climate Policy: Develop design guidelines for climate-adaptive and low-impact new subdivisions, neighborhoods, and planned developments.**

- **Climate Threat Addressed:**
  - The policy addresses threats such as flooding, sea level rise, chronic flooding, and the urban heat island effect.

- **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:**
  - This is an adaptation option aimed at reducing vulnerability to flooding and heat hazards. It involves developing new guidelines for tree cover, impervious surface coverage, resilient materials, and maximum floor area ratios.

- **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
  - While the intention is to create climate-adaptive new developments, these guidelines might inadvertently lead to maladaptation if they are not flexible enough to accommodate future changes in climate conditions. For example, rigid guidelines could result in developments that are not easily adaptable to unforeseen climate impacts, potentially leading to increased vulnerability over time. Additionally, if these guidelines are not implemented evenly or equitably, they could exacerbate social inequalities, leaving some communities more vulnerable than others.
