### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation?
**Answer:**
The plan addresses resilience, mitigation, and adaptation in various comprehensive ways:

### **Resilience**
- **Resilience Strategy**: The plan emphasizes a comprehensive approach to preparing for and adapting to shocks and stressors, aiming for a safe and thriving future for Jacksonville's people, economy, and physical environment. The concept of the "resilience dividend" is introduced, highlighting the additional benefits of investing in resilience, such as saving lives, boosting the economy, and improving community health and well-being *(EVOLVING CHALLENGES REQUIRE NEW APPROACHES RESILIENT JACKSONVILLE, Page 28)*.
- **Integration into Land Use Planning**: The plan incorporates resilience goals into Jacksonville’s 2030 Comprehensive Plan to guide growth and avoid development in high-risk areas, thus avoiding potential damages from flood events *(1.3 Incorporate resilience considerations into future land use planning)*.

### **Mitigation**
- **Climate Action Plan**: The development of a Climate Action Plan is highlighted to align Jacksonville’s resilience goals with sustainability, addressing large-scale contributors to climate change, such as greenhouse gas emissions. The plan includes actions to reduce emissions from transportation, buildings, electric power generation, and landfill waste *(ADAPTATION ACTIONS | PEOPLE RESILIENT JACKSONVILLE, Page 188-189)*.

### **Adaptation**
- **Adaptation Actions and Approaches**: The plan includes 45 Actions and 90 Sub-Actions organized across Systems, Sites, and People, focusing on guiding safe development, redesigning infrastructure, conserving open spaces, and fortifying critical systems *(ADAPTATION ACTIONS | SYSTEMS RESILIENT JACKSONVILLE, Page 68-69)*.

Overall, the plan extensively addresses resilience, mitigation, and adaptation through strategic planning, integration into existing frameworks, and the development of specific actions and policies.

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes several scenarios related to climate change that the planning jurisdiction, Jacksonville, is considering for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation planning. Here is a summary of one of the scenarios:

- **Future Without Action Scenario:** This scenario explores the potential consequences if recent development patterns continue without deliberate action. It notes that more than 85% of Jacksonville’s population growth in the last 20 years has been in Contemporary Suburbs, expanding into previously rural areas. If this pattern continues over the next 50 years, the remainder of the Rural Mosaic would need to transition to Contemporary Suburbs to accommodate more than 685,000 new residents. This would lead to suburbs dominating Jacksonville’s landscape, expanding from approximately 39% to more than 78% of the land area. The scenario warns that many new residents would be vulnerable to flooding and other climate threats unless expansion is focused away from high-risk areas *(Scenarios for Citywide Adaptation, Page 72-73)*.

- **Urban Core Growth Scenario:** This scenario considers the possibility of focusing growth in Jacksonville's urban core, which includes Downtown and Historic Walkable Neighborhoods. Currently, only about 1% of new residential development occurs in these areas. If growth shifts toward the urban core, it could offset low-density suburban growth, preserving open spaces in the Rural Mosaic. This scenario hypothesizes that if half of the projected 685,000 new residents over the next 50 years move to the urban core, the population density would increase significantly, similar to greater downtown Miami *(Scenarios for Citywide Adaptation, Page 266-267)*. 

These scenarios aim to guide the planning jurisdiction in shaping future development in a manner that accommodates population growth while addressing climate challenges.
