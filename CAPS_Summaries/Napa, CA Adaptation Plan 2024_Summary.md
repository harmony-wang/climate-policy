### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
**Resilience:**

The plan is heavily focused on resilience, with the primary objective being to "enhance the capacity of the County, local jurisdictions, and other regional or local agencies to adapt to climate stressors and bolster regional climate resilience" (Introduction). It proposes six adaptation strategies aimed at improving overall climate resilience, such as **Strategy 1: Improve the Overall Climate Resilience of Napa County**, which includes measures like promoting the implementation of measures and actions applicable throughout the region and increasing the climate resilience of existing and new residential and commercial development (Strategy 1).

**Mitigation:**

While the primary focus is on adaptation and resilience, the plan acknowledges the co-benefits of adaptation measures in terms of reducing GHG emissions. It mentions that adaptation measures may have "important co-benefits, such as reducing GHG emissions" and that further identification of these co-benefits will be completed as part of the RCAAP process (Introduction).

**Adaptation:**

Adaptation is a central component of the plan, as evidenced by the emphasis on developing climate adaptation strategies, measures, and actions. The plan proposes a comprehensive set of strategies, such as **Strategy 4: Prepare for More Frequent Extreme Precipitation and Flooding Events, Combined with Sea Level Rise Threat**, which focuses on enhancing resilience against climate stressors like flooding and sea level rise (Strategy 4).

**Classification:**

Based on the emphasis and content provided in the plan, it is best classified as an **adaptation/resilience dedicated** plan. The primary focus is on addressing climate vulnerabilities and enhancing resilience through adaptation strategies, while mitigation is considered more as a co-benefit rather than a primary objective.

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes scenarios of climate change that the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation. The scenarios include:

- **Increased Wildfire Risk:** The plan acknowledges the need to prepare for more frequent and severe wildfire events, while recognizing the role that beneficial fire plays in the county’s ecosystems. (*Strategy 2: Prepare for and Adapt to Increased Wildfire Risk*)
