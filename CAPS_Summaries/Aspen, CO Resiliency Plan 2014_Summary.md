### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based strictly on the document provided, the following potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies can be identified:

1. **Policy: Evaluation and possible revision of building codes and infrastructure standards**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy addresses the increase in hazards to structures and infrastructure from flood, fire, and drought. It also considers the increased demand for cooling in buildings and the reduction in heating requirements. (*Box 4.6 Infrastructure & Built Environment Summary Climate-related Changes*)
   
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** The proposed adaptation option is to evaluate and revise building codes and infrastructure standards to address changing hazard risks. (*Box 4.6 Infrastructure & Built Environment Summary Climate-related Changes*)
   
   - **Reason for Maladaptation:** This policy may inadvertently lead to maladaptation if the revised standards focus too narrowly on current hazards without considering future climate scenarios. If building codes are not sufficiently forward-looking, they might lock in infrastructure that is not resilient to future climate conditions, potentially increasing vulnerability over time.

2. **Policy: Integration of resilience and GHG reduction efforts into planning of codes and energy-intensive infrastructure**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy is aimed at addressing climate-related risks to infrastructure, such as floods and extreme weather events, that are exacerbated by climate change. (*Box 4.6 Infrastructure & Built Environment Summary Climate-related Changes*)
   
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** This option proposes integrating resilience and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction efforts into planning codes and energy-intensive infrastructure like transportation systems. (*Box 4.6 Infrastructure & Built Environment Summary Climate-related Changes*)
   
   - **Reason for Maladaptation:** The integration efforts may result in maladaptation if they prioritize short-term carbon reductions over long-term resilience. For instance, focusing on GHG reduction without adequately considering the resilience aspects could lead to infrastructure that is efficient but not robust against climate impacts, thereby increasing future risk.

3. **Policy: Development or adaptation of interactive tools that support local decision-making**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy aims to address the broader threats of climate change by aiding decision-making processes that consider possible scenarios and their impacts. (*Areas of research and resource development section*)
   
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** The adaptation option involves developing or adapting interactive decision support tools that consider possible climate scenarios. (*Areas of research and resource development section*)
   
   - **Reason for Maladaptation:** The use of such tools could inadvertently lead to maladaptation if they are based on incomplete or inaccurate data, or if they do not sufficiently account for local complexities and uncertainties. Over-reliance on these tools without critical evaluation may result in misguided planning and investment decisions that do not adequately prepare for future conditions.

These examples illustrate how policies intended to build resilience and adapt to climate change can sometimes have unintended negative consequences, highlighting the importance of comprehensive planning and consideration of long-term effects.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.
**Answer:**
The plan outlines various criteria for measuring the success of adaptation and resilience efforts but does not specify exact metrics or units such as reductions in CO2 emissions or improvements in air quality. Instead, it provides a framework for considering the success of these strategies. Here are the identified criteria and examples:

- **Economic Protection:** The plan emphasizes "minimizing or avoiding ﬁnancial losses and/or capitalizing on opportunities and beneﬁts" (*Chapter 6*).

- **Institutional Adequacy:** Success is measured by "preserving the ability of institutions, policies, and resource management to meet obligations to constituents as well as ecosystems" (*Chapter 6*).

- **Ecological and Environmental Protection:** Criteria include "preserving the resilience capacity, diversity, and services made possible by healthy ecosystems" (*Chapter 6*).

- **Social Justice:** The plan highlights "reducing vulnerabilities and/or inequities within marginalized populations while strengthening communities" (*Chapter 6*).

- **Political and Procedural Integrity:** This involves "supporting transparent and inclusive processes" (*Chapter 6*).

- **Cultural and Psychological Factors:** The plan aims at "preserving and/or enhancing vital aspects of community character and civic culture" (*Chapter 6*).

Additionally, the plan suggests a cyclical process of "Learning & Assessment," "Planning & Engagement," "Implementation & Monitoring," and "Evaluation" as part of the adaptation planning cycle, but it does not specify concrete goals, numerical objectives, or deadlines in terms of specific metrics such as CO2 reductions or air quality improvements (*Chapter 6*).

The document emphasizes the importance of an ongoing iterative process, which includes monitoring and evaluation based on established goals, but it does not detail specific quantifiable targets or units for tracking the outcomes of these adaptation, resilience, and mitigation options.
