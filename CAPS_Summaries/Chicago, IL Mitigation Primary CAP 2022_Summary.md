- **Areas or Populations:** Nature-based climate solutions are intended to benefit all communities by storing carbon and enhancing community well-being and resiliency. The aim is to address disparities in quality of life and ensure that “a zip code is no longer a determinant of life expectancy” (*Community Health and Resiliency*).

**5. Policy: Clean Energy Transition (Resolution R2019-157)**

- **Climate Threat:** The reliance on fossil fuels and associated environmental and health impacts.
  
- **Areas or Populations:** The policy is aimed at supporting frontline communities who have gained the least from past industrialization and bear the least responsibility for industrial pollution. It seeks to ensure that climate investments drive new opportunities and benefits for those most at risk of impact or further burden (*Policy Levers*).

Each of these policies is designed to address specific climate threats while prioritizing the needs of vulnerable and historically marginalized communities in Chicago.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
The document does not explicitly identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. However, it emphasizes the importance of equitable adaptation and resiliency efforts to prevent further harm and highlights the need for intentional consideration to avoid causing unintentional harm. Here are some points that imply potential risks if not carefully managed:

### Potential Risks of Maladaptation

1. **Equitable Access to Critical Infrastructure**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The transition to cleaner technologies and climate actions that require adopting new technology.
   - **Proposed Option:** Prioritizing actions and investments to ensure no Chicagoan is left behind in the transition to cleaner technologies.
