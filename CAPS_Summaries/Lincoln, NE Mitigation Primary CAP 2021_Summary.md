### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided content, no specific policies are explicitly identified as potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. However, I can outline general considerations related to maladaptation based on the information available:

1. **Policy: Reliance on Fossil Fuels**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The city's reliance on fossil fuels for energy and transportation.
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** The plan includes options such as the decarbonization of city fleet vehicles and the energy generation portfolio (Introduction).

2. **Policy: Auto-Reliant Transportation System**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The city's dependency on automobiles contributes to GHG emissions.
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** The plan proposes supporting commuter bus services and developing electric shuttle services (Key Initiatives).
   - **Potential Cause of Maladaptation:** If public transportation systems are not well-integrated or accessible, this could lead to increased emissions or social inequities if low-income populations cannot access these services.

3. **Policy: Floodplain Management and Infrastructure Development**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Flooding risks in the Salt Creek Watershed Basin.
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** Implementing recommendations from the Salt Creek Resiliency Study, including updated floodplain maps and regulatory amendments (Key Initiatives).
