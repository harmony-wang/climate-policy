### Question: Describe the physical and economic landscape of the jurisdiction as outlined in the plan. Include the name of the planning jurisdiction, its location, population, demographics, and average income. Include major geographic features such as mountains, rivers, deserts, and coastline, as well as any key infrastructure like airports or seaports.

Additionally, summarize the city’s energy production (oil, gas, renewables) and natural resources, and provide information about industries and economic drivers that are crucial to the region.
**Answer:**
The plan does not provide specific details about the physical and economic landscape of the planning jurisdiction, including its location, population, demographics, or average income. It also does not mention any major geographic features, key infrastructure like airports or seaports, or any specific details regarding the local climate, such as aridity or water challenges.

However, the plan does mention some aspects of the city's energy production and economic drivers:

- The city is exploring renewable energy options as part of its energy systems strategy. It mentions the potential for solar panels on city facilities and partnerships to support growth in renewable energy efforts, although it does not specify current energy production sources such as oil or gas. (*Section 3 Energy Systems*)
  
- The plan indicates that energy systems, including electricity use in city facilities, account for a significant portion of local government emissions. In 2018, 87% of local government emissions came from electricity and natural gas combined, which accounts for 133,553 tons of carbon dioxide. (*Section 3 Energy Systems*)

- The city has been participating in renewable energy efforts, with solar panels used on certain infrastructure, and aims to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions. (*Section 3 Energy Systems*)

- Regarding economic drivers, the plan does not provide specific industries or economic sectors that are crucial to the region. 

For further details about the economic landscape, industries, and natural resources, additional context or documents outside of this plan would be necessary.

### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
**Resilience:**

- The plan addresses resilience through strategies related to energy systems and green spaces. It includes goals like increasing energy efficiency and exploring renewable energy options, which contribute to the resilience of the city's infrastructure. For example, the plan states, "Lack of efficiency in buildings account for a majority of the energy use in the United States. There is opportunity to decrease this percentage by making more buildings energy efficient" (Section 3 Energy Systems).

**Mitigation:**

- The plan emphasizes mitigation by setting reduction targets and adopting various mitigation options. It sets goals for reducing emissions in transportation systems, energy systems, and waste systems. Specific actions include replacing lights in city facilities with LEDs, investing in solar panels, and encouraging diverse transportation options. The plan mentions, "There have been more instances of extreme weather events and progressively warmer years over the past decade than ever before. Continuing to be complacent about reducing emissions will have major repercussions on the future of our planet" (Executive Summary).

**Adaptation:**

- Adaptation is addressed through actions like carbon sequestration and the Bee City USA program, which aim to improve and protect natural systems. The plan includes strategies like planting trees and developing pollinator gardens to enhance the city's green infrastructure. The plan states, "Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide from our atmosphere... It is often the result of increased green infrastructure features such as a street tree system, green roofs, and an interconnected park system" (Section 4 Green Space).

**Classification:**

- Based on the content provided, the plan can be classified as an **equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan**. It balances efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) with strategies to enhance the city's ability to adapt to and recover from climate impacts (resilience and adaptation).

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes a scenario of climate change that the City of Winston-Salem is planning for. The major climate threats identified for the city include:

- **Extreme Temperatures:** "The biggest threats to the City of Winston-Salem are extreme temperatures, drought, and flood" (Executive Summary).
- **Drought:** "The biggest threats to the City of Winston-Salem are extreme temperatures, drought, and flood" (Executive Summary).
- **Flood:** "The biggest threats to the City of Winston-Salem are extreme temperatures, drought, and flood" (Executive Summary).

Furthermore, it is noted that there is an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which is at the root of these issues. The plan states, "Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from man-made sources have increased more from 2000 to 2010 than in the past three decades" (Where We Stand).

The potential future impacts include:
- "Projected weather patterns in Forsyth County could produce anywhere from 17 to 53 more extremely hot days per year, representing roughly another month of heat per year" (Where We Stand).

These scenarios are driving the city to implement climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation to address the identified threats and impacts.
