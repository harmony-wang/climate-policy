**Answer:**
Based on the content provided in the plan, here are potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies:

### 1. Stormwater Systems for a Changing Climate
- **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy is addressing threats from sea level rise, flooding, more frequent and extreme storms, and extreme heat. It also aims to protect the health of the Tampa Bay Watershed from ecosystem and habitat changes.
- **Option Proposed:** This policy proposes incorporating integrated stormwater infrastructure solutions into planning and design projects. It includes incorporating Green Infrastructure (GI) and Low Impact Development (LID) into City Capital Projects and promoting their use in citywide development and redevelopment projects. It also includes climate-informed assessments and the creation of policies, manuals, and guidance documents to guide climate-resilient stormwater solutions.
- **Potential Maladaptation:** While the policy aims to incorporate green and low-impact infrastructure solutions, there is a risk that without careful implementation, these projects could inadvertently lead to increased vulnerability. For instance, selecting inappropriate sites for GI or LID could disrupt existing ecosystems or fail to account for social vulnerabilities, leading to negative consequences for communities that are already at risk of flood impacts. The emphasis on creating new infrastructure could also overlook the necessity of maintaining existing systems, leading to a disparity in resilience across different areas.

### 2. Incorporate Resilience Guidelines Into the Capital Planning Process
- **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy addresses sea level rise, flooding, more frequent and extreme storms, extreme heat, and inadequate transportation systems.
- **Option Proposed:** The policy involves developing and incorporating resilience guidelines into the capital planning process. Each department is to consider resilience principles during the annual development of the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP).
- **Potential Maladaptation:** By prioritizing resilience in capital projects, there is a risk that projects could be pushed forward based on their perceived resilience benefits, potentially overlooking other critical factors such as social equity or ecological balance. If the guidelines are not sufficiently comprehensive or inclusive, they could inadvertently prioritize infrastructure projects that benefit some areas or populations over others, leading to increased inequality and vulnerability in underserved neighborhoods.

These policies highlight the need for careful consideration of social and ecological factors in implementing climate adaptation strategies to avoid exacerbating existing vulnerabilities.
