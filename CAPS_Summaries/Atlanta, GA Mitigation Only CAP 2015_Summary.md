Additionally, there is no mention of aridity or water challenges beyond the general context of climate change impacts.

### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
### Resilience
The plan addresses resilience by incorporating strategies that help the City of Atlanta cope with climate hazards while maintaining essential functions. It mentions the benefits of climate protection measures such as enhancing energy security and reducing the demand during peak periods, which helps the city better cope with extreme weather conditions like prolonged heat waves. The plan states, “By increasing efficiency across the City of Atlanta, such service disruptions are less likely and the city will be able to better cope with those situations.” (*Introduction*)

### Mitigation
The plan places significant emphasis on mitigation, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across various sectors. It sets clear objectives and strategies for reducing emissions from commercial and residential buildings, transportation, and waste management. The plan aims to achieve a reduction in GHG emissions by 20% below 2009 levels by 2020 and 40% by 2030. It includes strategies such as retrofitting buildings, improving energy efficiency, and increasing waste diversion rates. “The Climate Action Plan drives and coordinates local efforts toward a reduction in GHG emissions by 20 percent below 2009 levels by 2020 and 40 percent below 2009 levels by 2030.” (*Purpose, Scope, and Process Behind the Climate Action Plan*)

### Adaptation
The plan touches on adaptation efforts by acknowledging the need to prepare for the anticipated impacts of climate change. It suggests that many mitigation activities will also aid in adaptation, such as reducing vehicle emissions to improve air quality and increasing energy efficiency to prevent service disruptions during heat waves. However, specific adaptation strategies are less detailed compared to mitigation efforts.

### Classification
Considering the emphasis on reducing GHG emissions and incorporating resilience and some adaptation measures, the plan can be classified as a **"mitigation primary climate action plan."**

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
The plan does not explicitly describe a specific scenario of climate change that the City of Atlanta will face. However, it does acknowledge the risks posed by climate change and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to current and future effects. The introduction states: 

"The City of Atlanta recognizes the risk that climate change poses to its citizens, and is acting now to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, or 'carbon footprint', of both its government operations and the community at-large through the innovative programs laid out in this Climate Action Plan." 

Additionally, the plan outlines objectives and strategies aimed at addressing major sources of emissions and achieving greenhouse gas reductions, as part of its overall framework for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation efforts.

### Question: What climate hazards does the plan identify as presenting climate risks for the planning jurisdiction? For each identified climate hazard, summarize the plan’s description of: 1. The climate hazard. 2. The climate risks it poses to the planning jurisdiction. 3. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.Generate a numbered list of every hazard identified in the plan. Make the list as long as necessary to accomodate every single hazard.
**Answer:**
1. **Extreme Heat**
   - **Climate Hazard:** The plan describes the urban heat island effect as a significant climate hazard. It states that this effect "produces a negative effect on human health and comfort because it warms days and nights and produces higher air pollution levels" (City of Atlanta Climate Action Plan, Page 40).
   - **Climate Risks:** The risks associated with extreme heat include "general discomfort, respiratory difficulties, exhaustion, non-fatal heat stroke, and heat-related mortality." Additionally, it negatively affects water quality as "hot pavement and rooftop surfaces transfer their excess heat to stormwater" (City of Atlanta Climate Action Plan, Page 40).
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** The plan does not specify particular areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to extreme heat. However, it suggests that urban areas with less vegetation and more impervious surfaces are more affected by the urban heat island effect (City of Atlanta Climate Action Plan, Page 40).

### Question: What resilience options are identified in the plan? For each option, summarize: 1. The specific climate threat it addresses; 2. Details on cost, timeframe, and location, including any references found in tables, charts, or images that might contain this data; 3. Other important attributes, such as economic, environmental, or infrastructural considerations.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided excerpts from the City of Atlanta Climate Action Plan, specific resilience options are not explicitly detailed. The plan focuses more on mitigation strategies and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. However, there are references to resilience principles in the broader context of the plan. Below is a summary based on the available information:

1. **Climate Threat Addressed:**
   - The plan discusses "extreme and prolonged heat waves" as a climate threat that can "put considerable strain on the reliability of energy delivery in peak periods" (City of Atlanta Climate Action Plan, Page 8).

### Question: What adaptation options does the plan identify? For each identified adaptation option, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Information provided in the plan regarding cost, timeframe, location, and other important attributes.
**Answer:**
The document provided does not explicitly list specific adaptation options, nor does it detail their associated climate threats, costs, timeframes, locations, or other attributes. The focus of the plan is primarily on mitigation efforts, particularly through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. However, it acknowledges that many of the mitigation actions will also help the City of Atlanta adapt to a changing climate.

**General Reference to Adaptation:**

- **Climate Threat Addressed:** The plan mentions that "extreme and prolonged heat waves can put considerable strain on the reliability of energy delivery in peak periods" which implies the adaptation aspect of maintaining energy delivery during such climate events.
  
- **Attributes:** By increasing efficiency across the City of Atlanta, the plan suggests that "such service disruptions are less likely and the city will be able to better cope with those situations" (City of Atlanta Climate Action Plan, Other Benefits of Climate Protection Measures).

If more detailed adaptation options are provided in other parts of the document that were not included in the excerpts, they would need to be examined to provide further specifics.

### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan does not explicitly mention specific climate policies that advance climate justice, nor does it provide detailed information on the climate threats these policies address or the areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability. The document focuses on general strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving sustainability within the City of Atlanta but does not specifically address climate justice or vulnerable populations in relation to identified climate hazards.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided sections of the City of Atlanta Climate Action Plan, there are no explicitly identified maladaptive climate policies. However, I can infer and highlight some potential concerns that might lead to maladaptation based on the types of policies mentioned. 

### **Potential Maladaptive Considerations:**

1. **Tree Protection and Urban Canopy Maintenance**
   - **Climate Threat:** This policy addresses urban heat island effects and air quality issues.
   - **Option Proposed:** The plan includes maintaining and increasing the tree canopy in the City of Atlanta through a "Tree Protection Ordinance." (_City of Atlanta Climate Action Plan Page 44 of 53_)
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** While increasing tree canopy generally provides cooling and improves air quality, if not carefully managed, this policy might inadvertently limit urban development or increase water demand for maintenance, which could lead to conflicts over land use or water resources, particularly during drought conditions.

2. **Urban Agriculture/Vertical Farming Practices**
   - **Climate Threat:** This policy aims to address food security and reduce food deserts.
   - **Option Proposed:** The plan supports increasing urban agriculture and vertical farming practices. (_City of Atlanta Climate Action Plan Page 44 of 53_)
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** While promoting urban agriculture can enhance local food security, if not properly managed, it could lead to increased water and energy consumption, potentially exacerbating resource scarcity or increasing GHG emissions if fossil-fuel-dependent technologies are employed.

3. **Increasing Park Land and Accessibility**
   - **Climate Threat:** This policy targets urban heat and aims to improve community health and air quality.
   - **Option Proposed:** The plan includes increasing park land to 7% by 2020 and 10% by 2025, and ensuring accessibility to parks for a larger portion of the population. (_City of Atlanta Climate Action Plan Page 44 of 53_)
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** Expanding park lands could potentially lead to displacement of residents or businesses, or limit space available for necessary urban infrastructure, thereby inadvertently increasing socio-economic vulnerabilities or reducing resilience in other areas.

These examples highlight potential areas for maladaptation, but the plan does not explicitly outline these as maladaptive policies. Careful planning and stakeholder engagement are crucial to mitigating such risks.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.
**Answer:**
**Metrics for Measuring Success or Failure:**

The plan primarily uses **emission reductions** as a metric for measuring success across various focus areas. This is expressed in terms of **Million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (mTCO2e)**.

- **GHG Emissions Reduction:** 
  - "Reduce energy consumption in commercial buildings 20% by 2020 and 40% by 2030."
  - "Reduce energy consumption in residential buildings 20% by 2020 and 40% by 2030."
  - "Reduce GHG emissions produced by transportation 20% by 2020 and 40% by 2030."
  - "Increase waste diversion rate to landfills up to 80% by 2020."

**Specific Metrics and Units:**

- **Transportation**: 
  - "Transportation accounts for 31% of City of Atlanta’s total GHG emissions."
  - Reduction Potential: "Reduce emissions from transportation by 20% from 2009 baseline by 2020."

- **Green Spaces/Food Security**:
  - "Maintain and Increase park land to 7% by 2020 and 10% by 2025; accessibility to parks (half mile) to 40% of the population by 2020 and 45% by 2025."

**Concrete Goals or Targets:**

- **Overall GHG Reduction Targets**:
  - "Reduction targets to reduce its emissions to 20 percent below 2009 levels by 2020, and 40 percent below 2009 levels by 2030."
  - "Savings are projected to result in total reductions of 2.06 Million mTCO2e by 2020."

The plan does not explicitly mention specific units for air quality improvements or index values, but it does highlight the overall goal of reducing emissions and improving air quality as part of its broader climate action objectives.
