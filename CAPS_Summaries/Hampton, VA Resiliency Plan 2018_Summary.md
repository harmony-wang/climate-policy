### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
### Resilience

The plan places a strong emphasis on **resilience**, incorporating it into multiple facets of its strategy. It aims to bolster community strengths to alleviate chronic stresses and enable recovery from extreme events. The plan highlights that "Resilience is the bolstering of a community’s inherent strengths in order to alleviate chronic stresses and enable recovery from extreme events and shocks in ways that make the community even stronger than before" (*A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE AND RESILIENCY*). Additionally, the plan outlines resilience strategies at various scales, from regional to individual parcels, emphasizing the importance of a collaborative approach with multiple partners (*A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE AND RESILIENCY*).

### Mitigation

Mitigation is addressed through strategies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing water management systems. The plan includes goals such as "Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions" and "Promote/incentivize parcel-level adaptations and improvements that reduce runoff" (*A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE AND RESILIENCY*). However, the primary focus seems to be on adaptation and resilience rather than direct mitigation efforts.

### Adaptation

Adaptation is a central focus of the plan, with strategies addressing sea level rise and flood risks. The plan outlines various adaptation measures, such as modifying zoning and land use policies, expanding water management policies, and promoting educational and recreational opportunities related to habitat preservation (*A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE AND RESILIENCY*). The adaptation of existing infrastructure is prioritized to improve resilience against future conditions like sea level rise (*A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE AND RESILIENCY*).

### Classification

Based on the content and emphasis of the plan, it can be classified as an **adaptation/resilience dedicated plan**. The plan's primary focus is on building resilience and adapting to climate impacts, with mitigation being a supportive component rather than the central focus.

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes a scenario of climate change that the planning jurisdiction, Hampton, will face. The document highlights multiple forces of water impacting the city, which are exacerbated by climate change. These include:

- **Sea Level Rise**: Hampton is facing "sea level rise and increased precipitation," which amplify storm surge, surface runoff, and tidal action (A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE AND RESILIENCY, Executive Summary).
  
- **Flooding**: The area is subject to "nuisance flooding from higher tides" and the threat of "repetitive loss from flooding" (A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE AND RESILIENCY, Executive Summary).

- **Storm Events**: The city must prepare for "future shocks from large weather events" and has "weathered a number of significant storms over the years" (Preparing for the Future).

These elements form a part of Hampton's new normal and are central to their planning for resilience, adaptation, and mitigation. The plan aims to address these ongoing stresses and prepare for future events through a holistic approach, emphasizing the importance of "working with the water" and treating it as an asset (A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE AND RESILIENCY, Executive Summary).

### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan identifies several climate policies to advance climate justice, focusing on equitable strategies to address environmental risks. Here is a summary of these policies:

1. **Equitable Strategies**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The plan addresses environmental risks such as flooding and pollution, which can disproportionately affect marginalized communities.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** The plan specifically aims to strengthen marginalized sectors of the community who are disproportionately affected by these environmental risks due to factors such as lack of services or investment. It emphasizes the importance of creating benefits for all, ensuring widespread access to benefits and services, and social justice. (*A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE AND RESILIENCY, Section 2. Equitable*)

2. **Community Engagement and Ownership**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** General risks associated with climate change, including flooding and pollution.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** The plan encourages citizen ownership and involvement, suggesting that community-driven approaches can help address the needs of those most vulnerable to climate impacts. Emphasizing social justice and equitable access to benefits ensures that marginalized communities are acknowledged and prioritized. (*A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE AND RESILIENCY, Section 2. Equitable*)

The plan’s approach is to integrate community values and ensure that the benefits and burdens of climate change are shared equitably, focusing on strengthening those who are most vulnerable to climate impacts.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided document, the following potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies can be identified:

1. **Policy of Moving Critical Assets out of Flood Zones**
   - **Climate Threat:** This policy addresses the threat of flooding due to sea level rise and storm events. *"Move critical assets (eg. emergency services, police stations, etc.) out of flood zones when feasible."* (Chapter 55)
   - **Option:** This is primarily an adaptation option as it involves adjusting the location of critical infrastructure to minimize harm from flooding.
   - **Inadvertent Maladaptation:** This could lead to maladaptation if the relocation of critical assets results in them being less accessible to the communities they serve, particularly if the new locations are further from vulnerable populations or if the cost of relocation diverts resources from other essential adaptation measures.

2. **Policy of Installing Tide Gates**
   - **Climate Threat:** It addresses flooding from high tides and storm surges. *"Evaluate the benefits and costs of installing tide gates at various locations."* (Chapter 55)
   - **Option:** This is an adaptation option involving infrastructure changes to manage water levels.
   - **Inadvertent Maladaptation:** Tide gates can cause maladaptation if they disrupt natural tidal flows and negatively impact local ecosystems, potentially leading to unforeseen ecological consequences. Moreover, reliance on such infrastructure might reduce incentives for other more sustainable or holistic flood management practices.

3. **Policy of Encouraging Graywater Reuse**
   - **Climate Threat:** This policy addresses water scarcity and management issues. *"Modify or make exceptions to building codes and regulations to allow/facilitate graywater reuse."* (Chapter 51)
   - **Option:** This is an adaptation option that seeks to optimize water resource management.
   - **Inadvertent Maladaptation:** Encouraging graywater reuse could lead to maladaptation if not properly regulated, as improper graywater systems can lead to health risks from water contamination, especially if used for purposes that are not entirely safe or in areas without proper infrastructure to handle it.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.
**Answer:**
The plan does not specify exact metrics or units for measuring the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option. However, it does outline several general approaches and principles for evaluation and monitoring:

- **Evaluation Tool:** The plan mentions the development and use of an "evaluation tool" to guide decision-making. It states that this tool "will be applied to most major investment decisions" and is designed to provide "useful information and context as to how particular investments or policy decisions may 'score' relative to the values and goals identified as most important to our community" (A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE AND RESILIENCY).

- **Short-term Objectives:** The plan indicates that there will be "targeted benchmarks" and "short-term, measurable objectives" to allow for clear identification of "successes as well as areas in which we may have fallen short" (Goal Statements).

- **Regular Evaluation:** It mentions a regular “evaluation” process to reassess the effectiveness of strategies, allowing for adjustments as conditions change to achieve the best results (Goal Statements).

- **Holistic Assessment:** The evaluation tool is described as a "holistic assessment" that uses a simple matrix to score projects based on how well they meet the community's values and principles (Using the Evaluation Tool).

The plan lacks specific numerical targets, deadlines, or units for tracking outcomes such as reductions in CO2 emissions or improvements in air quality.
