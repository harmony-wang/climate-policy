### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan does not explicitly mention any climate policies specifically addressing climate justice or directly identify areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to specific climate threats. Therefore, based on the provided content, I cannot summarize policies or identify specific populations related to climate justice.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
**1. Policy: Require all new local government facilities to achieve LEED certification.**

- **Climate Threat:** The policy aims to address the threat of increased GHG emissions and energy inefficiency in building infrastructure.
- **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** This is a mitigation option, as it seeks to reduce GHG emissions by ensuring that new buildings meet high environmental standards, specifically through the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification.
- **Potential Maladaptation:** The focus on LEED certification might potentially lead to increased costs for building construction without necessarily addressing broader climate vulnerabilities such as flooding or heatwaves. Additionally, the certification process may prioritize certain energy efficiency measures over other crucial adaptation measures, potentially neglecting the holistic resilience of the building to local climate impacts.

**2. Policy: Implement a countywide weatherization program for low-income housing.**

- **Climate Threat:** The policy is designed to address the threat of increased energy consumption and associated GHG emissions, particularly in housing for low-income residents.
- **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** This is primarily a mitigation option, as it aims to reduce energy consumption through weatherization, thereby decreasing GHG emissions.
- **Potential Maladaptation:** While weatherization reduces energy costs and GHG emissions, it may inadvertently cause maladaptation if it does not also consider the need to enhance resilience to climate impacts such as extreme heat or cold. For instance, if weatherization leads to homes being more airtight without adequate ventilation, it might increase indoor air pollution or make homes less adaptable to temperature extremes.

**3. Policy: Use biodiesel for the County fleet.**

- **Climate Threat:** The policy addresses the threat of GHG emissions from transportation, aiming to reduce emissions from the county's vehicle fleet.
- **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** This is a mitigation option, as it seeks to lower GHG emissions by switching from fossil fuels to biodiesel.
- **Potential Maladaptation:** The switch to biodiesel may inadvertently lead to maladaptation if it results in increased land use change for biodiesel production, which could affect local ecosystems and biodiversity. Additionally, if biodiesel is not sourced sustainably, it might contribute to other environmental issues, such as deforestation or competition with food production.

**4. Policy: Commit to planting 365 new trees each year.**

- **Climate Threat:** The policy aims to address urban heat and air quality issues, as well as contribute to carbon sequestration to mitigate GHG emissions.
- **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** This is primarily a resilience and mitigation option, as trees provide shade and improve air quality while also absorbing CO₂.
- **Potential Maladaptation:** Planting trees without considering the local ecosystem's needs and water availability might lead to maladaptation. For instance, if non-native species are introduced or if trees are planted in areas with insufficient water resources, it could lead to increased water stress or ecosystem imbalances.

**5. Policy: Require all new CAT buses be hybrid, electric, or natural gas.**

- **Climate Threat:** This policy targets the threat of GHG emissions from public transportation.
- **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** It is a mitigation option, as it seeks to reduce emissions by transitioning to cleaner vehicle technologies.
- **Potential Maladaptation:** The policy could lead to maladaptation if it does not ensure the necessary infrastructure, such as charging stations for electric buses, is in place. Additionally, if the electricity or natural gas used is not sourced sustainably, it may not significantly reduce overall emissions and could lead to other environmental or social issues related to the energy supply chain.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.

| **Threats Identified** | - **Impacts of the built environment on the estuarine environment** (e.g., docks, upland development) (Section 6) <br> - **Coastal hazards and weather** (Section 6) <br> - **Groundwater issues**: saltwater intrusion and pressure (Section 6) <br> - **Climate change impacts**: The plan mentions the need to prepare and adopt a climate change adaptation plan (Section 3.4).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Measures Identified**| - **Greenhouse Gas Reduction Measures**: Implementing reduction strategies such as requiring LEED Silver buildings for new County-funded buildings, and adopting a grey water ordinance for new development (Section 3.4). <br> - **Energy Efficiency**: Improve energy efficiency of County owned buildings to reduce total energy consumption by 15% (Section 3.2). <br> - **Transportation Improvements**: Enhance streets for safe access for all users and create an integrated, multimodal transportation system (Section 3.3). <br> - **Water Management**: Specify effective and efficient use of water in government facilities and reduce stormwater runoff (Section 3.6). <br> - **Solid Waste Management**: Reduce environmental impacts of solid waste disposal by 50% by 2018 (Section 3.7).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
