### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided document, the following potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies can be identified:

1. **Increasing Urban Tree Canopy and Green Space**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Urban heat island effect and public health impacts due to reduced green space.
   - **Resilience/Mitigation/Adaptation Option:** "Increase Urban Tree Canopy and Green Space to Mitigate Urban Heat Island, Improve Public Health and Enhance Community Resiliency" (LIVABILITY).
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** Focusing tree planting in low-income neighborhoods may inadvertently neglect other areas that also experience heat island effects or require ecological enhancement. Additionally, if not managed properly, tree planting could lead to increased water consumption in areas facing water scarcity, thereby exacerbating climate vulnerability.

2. **Developing Permanent Supportive Housing for Homeless Families, Veterans, and Climate Refugees**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Housing shortages and increased climate refugees due to extreme weather events.
   - **Resilience/Mitigation/Adaptation Option:** "Develop Permanent Supportive Housing for Homeless Families, Veterans and Climate Refugees" which includes the idea of establishing tiny-house villages (LIVABILITY).
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** If not planned with consideration of local climate risks such as flooding or heat exposure, these housing solutions could place vulnerable populations in areas that are not resilient to future climate impacts. Additionally, the focus on tiny-house villages might not address broader systemic issues related to housing affordability and infrastructure resilience.

3. **Amending the Land Development Code for Smart Irrigation Technologies**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Water scarcity and inefficient water use in residential and commercial properties.
   - **Resilience/Mitigation/Adaptation Option:** "Amend the Land Development Code to Require Smart Irrigation Technologies for Both New Residential and Commercial Construction" (WATER).
