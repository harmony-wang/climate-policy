### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided content, there are no explicitly identified climate policies within the plan that are flagged as causing potential unforeseen maladaptation. However, I can provide a general analysis for potential areas of concern:

1. **Climate Threat: Extreme Heat**
   - **Proposed Adaptation Option:** "Incentivize installation of cool roofs and green roofs." (*Policy RE-2*)
   - **Potential Maladaptation Concern:** While cool roofs can help reduce heat absorption and lower indoor temperatures, they may inadvertently increase energy consumption if not properly integrated with the building's overall energy system, leading to higher greenhouse gas emissions if the energy source is not renewable.

2. **Climate Threat: Flooding**
   - **Proposed Adaptation Option:** "Implement resilient redesign or identify less intensive land uses for City-owned property exposed to flooding." (*Appendix A*)
   - **Potential Maladaptation Concern:** Redesigning or changing land use could lead to economic or social displacement if not carefully planned with community involvement, particularly affecting vulnerable populations who might rely on those areas.

3. **Climate Threat: Energy Disruption**
   - **Proposed Mitigation Option:** "Consider the value of combining renewable generation with battery energy storage systems and/or microgrid installations." (*Appendix A*)
   - **Potential Maladaptation Concern:** The installation of microgrids and battery storage systems could lead to increased costs and resource allocation that may not be sustainable in the long term or may inadvertently increase reliance on rare materials with high environmental extraction costs.

These concerns are extrapolated based on general knowledge of maladaptation risks and are not directly mentioned as such in the document.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.
**Answer:**
The plan does not specify exact metrics, units, or concrete numerical goals or deadlines for measuring the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option. However, it emphasizes the importance of monitoring, community involvement, and flexibility in implementing strategies. Here are some relevant points:

- **Monitoring and Adaptive Implementation:**
  - "As the City implements Climate Resilient SD, continued effort will be needed to monitor the success and outcomes of adaptation strategies as they are implemented." (*Implementation Framework*)
  - "To continue to reflect best available science, community need and implementation outcomes, the Climate Resilient SD plan should be updated regularly, at least every 5 years." (*Implementation Framework*)

- **Tracking Systems:**
  - "Create a City tracking system to monitor the cost of climate change hazard impacts and response." (*Appendix A*)
  - "Develop post-hazard tracking system to collect post-event cost data for events that are both above and below the national hazard declaration threshold." (*Appendix A*)

- **Prioritization Factors:**
  - "Policy CCS-5: Consider cost, effectiveness, lifespan, and core benefits for adaptation strategy prioritization and implementation." (*Appendix A*)

- **Community Engagement:** 
  - "Successful implementation of these strategies will require continued community involvement, working closely with community members to identify community needs and opportunities, especially in our underserved communities." (*How We Will Thrive*)

The plan does not detail specific numerical objectives or deadlines related to metrics such as reductions in CO2 emissions or improvements in air quality. Instead, it focuses on a flexible, adaptive approach with an emphasis on community engagement and regular updates to the strategies based on new data and outcomes.
