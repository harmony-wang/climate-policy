The plan includes goals like "Use 100% Renewable Energy for City-Owned Facilities and Enhance Energy Efficiency for City-Owned Facilities" and activities such as "Continue Installation of Renewable Energy Resources on Municipal Property" and "Expand Energy Efficiency Standards for All New Construction to Retrofits and Upgrades" (*Executive Summary*, *Appendix A: Summary of Sustainability and Climate Activities*).

**Adaptation:**

Adaptation is also a significant component of the plan, with activities designed to cope with and withstand climate impacts. For example, the plan proposes to "Update City-Owned Building Standards for Resilience Considerations," which includes considerations for climate adaptation (*Appendix A: Summary of Sustainability and Climate Activities*). The plan also emphasizes embedding sustainability and resilience in decision-making processes (*Executive Summary*).

**Classification:**

Based on the emphasis on both mitigation and adaptation strategies, the plan can be classified as an **equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan**. It balances activities aimed at reducing emissions with those enhancing resilience and adaptation to climate impacts.

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
The plan does not explicitly describe a specific scenario of climate change that the planning jurisdiction will face. However, it recognizes the impacts associated with climate-related hazard events and the importance of resilience, mitigation, and adaptation. It mentions:

- "As the climate changes, it is increasingly important to ensure that new buildings and major retrofits or repairs are constructed to withstand and recover from climate-related events" (*Implementation*).
- "As climate change results in more frequent and more intense storms and weather-related events, the need to incorporate climate resilience and climate equity considerations into the City’s emergency response continues to grow" (*Goal 1*).

These statements imply that the City is preparing for increased frequency and intensity of climate-related events, such as storms and extreme weather, but a detailed scenario is not provided.

### Question: What climate hazards does the plan identify as presenting climate risks for the planning jurisdiction? For each identified climate hazard, summarize the plan’s description of: 1. The climate hazard. 2. The climate risks it poses to the planning jurisdiction. 3. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.Generate a numbered list of every hazard identified in the plan.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the document provided, here are some potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies:

1. **Policy: Establish a Policy for the Purchase, Sale, or Adaptive Reuse of Highly Vulnerable or Underutilized Assets**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy addresses the threat of climate impacts on city-owned facilities or assets that are vulnerable or underutilized. It aims to manage the financial risks associated with maintaining such assets which are expensive and carbon-intensive. 

   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** The policy proposes the adaptive reuse, sale, or purchase of vulnerable assets, incorporating sustainability, resilience, and adaptation considerations into the decision-making process. This involves assessing the costs of acquisition, hardening, restoration, and reconfiguration for reuse, as well as evaluating vulnerability and potential revenue or savings.

   - **Potential Maladaptation:** The policy may inadvertently lead to maladaptation if the adaptive reuse or sale of assets does not adequately consider long-term climate projections or community needs, potentially leaving critical infrastructure under-resourced or exposing communities to greater risks. In focusing on financial risks, there might be a risk of prioritizing short-term economic benefits over long-term resilience, resulting in increased vulnerability or loss of critical services over time. Moreover, selling assets to private entities may result in a loss of public control over essential services or amenities, potentially exacerbating social inequities.

**Note:** While the document presents this policy as a proactive measure to ensure asset resilience, the potential for maladaptation lies in the execution and prioritization of financial over community resilience considerations.
