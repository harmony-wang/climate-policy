**Mitigation:**

Mitigation is a primary focus of the plan. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and addresses the root cause of climate change. The plan outlines specific emission reduction goals: "Reduce emissions 56% below 2018 levels by 2030" and "Reduce emissions to net zero by 2050" (Executive Summary). Additionally, it includes mitigation actions such as reducing energy use, waste, and fostering renewable energy (Introduction).

**Adaptation:**

The plan supports adaptation by building on existing adaptation strategies, particularly those in the City’s Flooding and Sea Level Rise Strategy. It states: "Since adaptation measures...are the primary initiatives in the City’s Flooding and Sea Level Rise Strategy, the Climate Action Plan builds on that base by focusing on climate mitigation measures" (Executive Summary). This indicates that while the primary focus is on mitigation, adaptation is integrated and supported.

**Classification:**

The plan can be classified as a **mitigation primary climate action plan**. While it acknowledges and supports adaptation and resilience, the primary emphasis is on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing the root cause of climate change through mitigation strategies.

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes a scenario of climate change that Charleston will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation.

- **Climate Impacts:** The plan acknowledges that "overuse of fossil fuels has already given rise to an array of flooding, rain bombs, wildfires, landslides, spiking heat waves, droughts, and the threat of global food shortages." Locally, Charleston is experiencing "more flooding, more extreme storms, more sea level rise." (Introduction)

- **Anthropogenic Emissions:** The plan states that "because we burn too much fossil fuel, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions are accumulating rapidly in the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect (hence, greenhouse gases), that overly warms the earth; this in turn has led to changes in climate patterns." (Introduction)

- **Future Emissions Scenario:** The plan notes that human-caused carbon emissions "reached a peak in the early part of the 21st century, produced primarily by the energy and transportation sectors of the economy." It further anticipates that "these emissions could double by 2050 —fewer than three decades from now." (Introduction)

These scenarios underline the urgency and necessity for Charleston to implement climate policies focused on resilience, mitigation, and adaptation to address the described and projected climate impacts.
