### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes a scenario of climate change impacts that Cincinnati will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation. The scenario includes the following elements:

- **Rising Temperatures and Severe Storms:** "The earth is getting hotter and so is Cincinnati. Historically, Cincinnati experiences about 30 days a year with a heat index over 90°F. By mid-century, it will be 79 days. By 2080, the average daily temperature is projected to be more than 10°F hotter." Additionally, "Cincinnati is actually experiencing more storms. Annual precipitation in the Midwest has increased 5-10% since 1950." (Why a Green Cincinnati Plan?)

- **Local Impacts on Ecosystem, Infrastructure, and Health:** "As Cincinnati’s climate changes, there will be impacts to our ecosystem, infrastructure, and the health and well-being of residents." The document mentions health implications such as an increase in heat-related illnesses and additional pressures on healthcare services. (Climate Change in Cincinnati—Why we need the Green Cincinnati Plan)

- **Agricultural Disruptions:** Rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns are expected to lead to a "5-25% decline in corn and soybean crop yields by mid-century" and other challenges such as flooding, increased pest and weed populations, and loss of native species. (Why a Green Cincinnati Plan?)

- **Climate Migration:** "Extreme heat, more frequent large flood events, forest fires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters are displacing people from their communities," indicating that climate migration is a consideration for the planning jurisdiction. (Why a Green Cincinnati Plan?)

The plan outlines strategies to address these scenarios through resilience, mitigation, and adaptation, such as reducing carbon emissions, developing policies to protect vulnerable lands and infrastructure, and focusing on equity to ensure that priority communities are equipped to handle climate impacts.

### Question: What climate hazards does the plan identify as presenting climate risks for the planning jurisdiction? For each identified climate hazard, summarize the plan’s description of: 1. The climate hazard. 2. The climate risks it poses to the planning jurisdiction. 3.

Make the list as long as necessary to accomodate every single hazard.
**Answer:**
1. **Rising Temperatures**
   - *Description:* "The earth is getting hotter and so is Cincinnati. Historically, Cincinnati experiences about 30 days a year with a heat index over 90°F. By mid-century, it will be 79 days. By 2080, the average daily temperature is projected to be more than 10°F hotter." (Why is Climate Change Happening?)
   - *Climate Risks:* "An increase in the number of dangerously hot days will lead to an increase in heat-related illnesses, including heat rash and cramps, and potentially fatal illnesses like asthma and heat stroke. Similarly, extreme temperatures put additional pressures on hospitals, emergency rooms, and medical services." (Why is Climate Change Happening?)
   - *Vulnerable Areas/Populations:* "The 2020 Heat Watch Cincinnati study identified the neighborhoods in Cincinnati with the greatest urban heat island exposure. These include predominately low-income communities of color that were historically red-lined and where residents have been systematically denied access to financial services." (Why a Green Cincinnati Plan?)

2. **Severe Storms and Flooding**
   - *Description:* "While many parts of the world are experiencing drought, Cincinnati is actually experiencing more storms. Annual precipitation in the Midwest has increased 5-10% since 1950. Not only will the Cincinnati region see more storms, the storms will be more severe." (Why is Climate Change Happening?)
   - *Climate Risks:* "Increasing storms and flooding can also lead to adverse health effects, especially in areas where sewer and water infrastructure is inadequate. Flooding from storms can cause sewer back-ups into homes and businesses, and water intrusion into buildings, resulting in increased exposure to pathogens and illness. Flooded homes can cause sleeplessness, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder." (Why a Green Cincinnati Plan?)
   - *Vulnerable Areas/Populations:* "Similarly, with storms, these issues do not impact residents equally. The effects of storms more severely impact residents in neighborhoods on hillsides and in valleys." (Why a Green Cincinnati Plan?)

3. **Agricultural Disruptions**
   - *Description:* "As increased heat causes local waterways to evaporate, this decrease in water supply will negatively impact agricultural productivity. Crop loss is one of the chronic threats to agriculture from climate change in the Greater Cincinnati Area." (Why a Green Cincinnati Plan?)
   - *Climate Risks:* "Rising temperatures are expected to extend the frost-free season 20 days by mid-century. While this might increase crop yield, hotter summers and periods of drought are expected to lead to a 5-25% decline in corn and soybean crop yields by mid-century." (Why a Green Cincinnati Plan?)
   - *Vulnerable Areas/Populations:* The plan does not specify particular areas or populations vulnerable to agricultural disruptions.

4. **Climate Migration**
   - *Description:* "Extreme heat, more frequent large flood events, forest fires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters are displacing people from their communities." (Why a Green Cincinnati Plan?)
   - *Climate Risks:* "Cities in the Midwest are expected to experience climate migration from communities impacted by sea level rise and other natural disasters." (Why a Green Cincinnati Plan?)

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided excerpts from the Green Cincinnati Plan 2023, here are potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies:

1. **Climate Policy: Low Impact Development**

   - **Climate Threat it is Addressing:**
     - This policy addresses vulnerabilities to climate change in urban areas due to land use sensitivity, particularly in "highly concentrated urban areas (e.g., heat islands and stormwater-impermeable hardscapes), flood zones, and hillsides" (FOCUS AREA Resilience & Climate Adaptation).

   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:**
     - The policy proposes using Low Impact Development techniques to "protect vulnerable land use and core infrastructure" (FOCUS AREA Resilience & Climate Adaptation).

   - **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
     - The policy may inadvertently result in maladaptation if it prioritizes infrastructure protection without considering the socio-economic impacts on priority communities, which "need these services to survive" (FOCUS AREA Resilience & Climate Adaptation). If the policy leads to increased development costs or restricts affordable housing in these areas, it could exacerbate existing vulnerabilities rather than alleviate them.

2. **Climate Policy: Green Infrastructure Implementation**

   - **Climate Threat it is Addressing:**
     - This policy addresses the urban heat island effect and stormwater management, particularly in areas with "large areas with impervious surfaces and gray infrastructure" (FOCUS AREA Resilience & Climate Adaptation).

   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:**
     - The policy promotes the use of green infrastructure solutions such as "green roofs, bioswales, green medians, wetlands, parks, permeable pavements, and landscape gardens" (FOCUS AREA Resilience & Climate Adaptation).

   - **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
     - While green infrastructure is generally beneficial, if not carefully managed, it may lead to increased maintenance costs or insufficient performance under extreme weather conditions. Additionally, if green infrastructure is implemented without adequate community involvement, it may not meet the needs or address the priorities of the local residents, potentially marginalizing vulnerable groups further.

3. **Climate Policy: Resilience Hubs Development**

   - **Climate Threat it is Addressing:**
     - This policy is intended to increase emergency preparedness and serve as coordinated resource distribution centers in response to climate challenges (FOCUS AREA Resilience & Climate Adaptation).

   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:**
     - It proposes creating resilience hubs that are "Community institutions enhanced to increase adaptive capacity" and provide various support services (FOCUS AREA Resilience & Climate Adaptation).

   - **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
     - If resilience hubs are not strategically located or are inadequately resourced, they may fail to effectively serve the priority communities most in need. Additionally, focusing resources on resilience hubs might divert attention from addressing underlying infrastructure vulnerabilities or fail to integrate with existing community systems, leading to ineffective resilience building.

These examples highlight the importance of considering broader socio-economic impacts and ensuring equitable implementation to avoid maladaptation.
