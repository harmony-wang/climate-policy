### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided document, here are potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies:

1. **Policy: Improve onsite stormwater retention programs by incentivizing rain barrels, rain gardens, and green roofs.**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy addresses the threat of increased stormwater runoff due to extreme weather events and flooding, which can be exacerbated by climate change.
   
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** This is an adaptation option aimed at enhancing resilience by improving stormwater management and retention at the site level (BUILT ENVIRONMENT BE:2B).
   
   - **Potential Maladaptation Reason:** While the policy seeks to improve stormwater management, it may inadvertently lead to maladaptation if these systems are not properly maintained or designed for the specific local climate conditions. Improperly maintained green infrastructure could fail during extreme events, leading to increased flooding risk rather than mitigating it.

2. **Policy: Require all new commercial construction to meet electric vehicle (EV) readiness requirements for 20% of parking spaces by 2020.**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy addresses the threat of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, aiming to reduce emissions by promoting electric vehicle use.
   
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** This is a mitigation option focused on reducing GHG emissions by supporting the transition to electric vehicles (BUILT ENVIRONMENT BE:1B).
   
   - **Potential Maladaptation Reason:** If the transition to electric vehicles outpaces the development of renewable energy sources, the increased demand for electricity could lead to greater reliance on fossil fuels, thereby offsetting the intended reduction in GHG emissions. Additionally, if not equitably implemented, it may disproportionately benefit higher-income groups who can afford EVs, exacerbating social inequities.

3. **Policy: Increase street sweeping operations throughout the county to improve stormwater drainage.**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy targets the threat of clogged drainage systems leading to urban flooding, which is anticipated to increase with climate change.
   
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** This is a resilience option intended to enhance the effectiveness of stormwater drainage systems (BUILT ENVIRONMENT BE:2D).
   
   - **Potential Maladaptation Reason:** Increased street sweeping may lead to maladaptation if it primarily focuses on central areas while neglecting peripheral neighborhoods, potentially increasing the vulnerability of those areas to flooding. Additionally, if not managed sustainably, it could lead to higher operational costs and resource use, impacting long-term sustainability.

These policies, while well-intentioned, highlight the complex nature of climate adaptation and mitigation efforts and the need for careful planning and implementation to avoid unintended negative consequences.
