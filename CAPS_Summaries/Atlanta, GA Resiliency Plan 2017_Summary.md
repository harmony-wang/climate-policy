### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided plan, here are potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies:

1. **Policy: Protect and expand Atlanta’s tree canopy**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy addresses the threat to natural and man-made assets and aims to ensure public health services.
   - **Option Proposed:** The policy proposes to enhance and provide protective natural and man-made assets by increasing the number of acres of forested property and trees planted on City-owned properties.
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** While expanding the tree canopy can enhance urban cooling and improve air quality, it may inadvertently lead to maladaptation if it results in reduced land availability for affordable housing. This could exacerbate housing insecurity in a city already facing significant gentrification and displacement pressures, as noted in the plan: "Many Atlantans identified housing and housing insecurity as a primary concern, especially in the context of increasing gentrification and risk of displacement" (*INTRODUCTION DEVELOPING RESILIENT ATLANTA*).

2. **Policy: Create a stormwater utility fee to develop and fund a comprehensive stormwater management program**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy addresses the continuity of critical services and enhances protective natural and man-made assets in response to stormwater flooding.
   - **Option Proposed:** The policy proposes to ensure continuity of critical services by implementing a stormwater utility fee to fund stormwater management.
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** Introducing a utility fee may inadvertently increase the financial burden on low-income households, potentially exacerbating economic inequities if not carefully managed. The plan highlights the importance of addressing socio-economic inequity: "address poverty and socio-economic inequity in the city and thus improving racial, economic, and social equity is paramount" (*INTRODUCTION DEVELOPING RESILIENT ATLANTA*).

3. **Policy: Increase use and access to solar energy by 2020 through the creation of Solarize Atlanta**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy addresses the need for meeting basic needs and ensuring continuity of critical services.
   - **Option Proposed:** The policy proposes increasing solar energy use by facilitating the adoption of solar technology across various sectors.
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** While promoting solar energy is a valuable mitigation strategy, it may inadvertently lead to maladaptation if the implementation disproportionately favors affluent neighborhoods, leaving vulnerable communities without access. The plan stresses the need for equitable access: "reduce the barriers preventing Atlantans from achieving economic stability and security to increase access to opportunity" (*INTRODUCTION EXECUTIVE SUMMARY*).

These examples illustrate how well-intentioned policies may lead to unintended consequences if not carefully planned and implemented with consideration of socio-economic and demographic factors.
