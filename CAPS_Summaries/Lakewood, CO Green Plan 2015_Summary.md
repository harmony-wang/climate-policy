### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
**Resilience:**

The plan emphasizes resilience by highlighting the need for cities to lead in mitigation efforts and by preparing for future climate variability. It states, "Action today will lead to a more resilient tomorrow" and notes that "cities are uniquely positioned to facilitate policy changes and bottom-up initiatives, leading to immediate results" (Chapter 01). The plan also includes strategies like expanding emergency preparedness plans and upgrading infrastructure to minimize vulnerability (CCA1-D).

**Mitigation:**

The plan includes clear mitigation goals, such as reducing communitywide greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent below 2007 levels by 2025 and by 50 percent by 2050 (Chapter 01). It also discusses the importance of cities in reducing GHG emissions, stating, "cities, which account for more than half of global GHG emissions and two-thirds of energy production, to lead the way in mitigation efforts" (Mitigation Section).

**Adaptation:**

Adaptation is addressed through the development of a climate preparedness plan and the necessity of local strategies to handle climate impacts. The plan recognizes the need for climate vulnerability assessments to identify specific risks and vulnerabilities (Adaptation Section). It includes adaptation strategies like developing economic, social, and natural resource management policies to address vulnerabilities (CCA1-D).

**Classification:**

The plan can be classified as an **equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan**. It addresses both mitigation and adaptation with specific goals, targets, and strategies for reducing GHG emissions and preparing for climate change impacts, reflecting a balanced approach to both components.

**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes potential scenarios of climate change that the City of Lakewood might face. It outlines anticipated changes and their impacts, including:

- **Drought and Water Supply Issues:** "Drought, reduced snowpack, strained water supply, disaster recovery costs, and other impacts are already influencing municipal operations and household economies." (Chapter 01, Climate Change and Adaptation)

- **Temperature Increases:** "Even if all GHG emission from human activity ceased, global temperatures are still expected to rise by 0.5 F over the next few decades. In Colorado, moderate to aggressive efforts to mitigate CO2 emissions would still lead to increased average annual temperatures of 2.5 F by 2025 and 4 F by 2050." (Chapter 01, Climate Change and Adaptation)

- **Flooding and Infrastructure Damage:** "Floods in the U.S. caused 4,586 deaths, and in September 2013 flooding in Colorado resulted in an estimated 2,000 damaged or destroyed homes." (Chapter 01, Climate Change and Adaptation)

- **Impacts on Human and Ecosystem Health:** "Existing health risks, such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, mental health, and stress-related disorders are all amplified by extreme weather, air pollution, and altered infectious disease transmission cycles." (Chapter 01, Climate Change and Adaptation)

The plan emphasizes the importance of preparing for these potential scenarios and implementing strategies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation.

### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan does not explicitly label specific climate policies as addressing climate justice directly. However, it implies the importance of addressing climate vulnerabilities and ensuring equitable outcomes through its broader goals and strategies.

### Implicit Climate Policies Related to Climate Justice

**1. Climate Preparedness Plan**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This policy addresses multiple climate threats, including extreme weather events, strained water supplies, and public health risks.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Vulnerable populations such as children, older adults, low-income groups, and those with chronic illnesses are mentioned as disproportionately affected by climate change impacts like extreme weather and air pollution. 
   - *"Vulnerable populations, such as children, older adults, low-income groups, and those with chronic illnesses, will disproportionately suffer from the added stresses of climate change impacts."* (Chapter: Climate Change and Adaptation)

**2. Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** This assessment aims to identify potential changes and threats to Lakewood’s climate, including infrastructure and public safety vulnerabilities.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** The assessment seeks to identify vulnerabilities and impacts on infrastructure, natural resources, ecosystems, public safety, economic well-being, and the overall resiliency of the population.
   - *"Identify vulnerabilities and potential impacts of each scenario on Lakewood’s infrastructure, natural resources, ecosystems, public safety, economic well-being, population, and overall resiliency."* (Chapter: Implementation Strategies)

These policies, while not directly labeled as climate justice initiatives, highlight the plan's focus on understanding and addressing vulnerabilities across various areas and populations, which aligns with the principles of climate justice.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided document, no specific climate policies are explicitly identified as potentially leading to maladaptation. The plan focuses on climate adaptation, mitigation, and resilience strategies, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change impacts. However, there are some general points to consider that could potentially lead to maladaptation if not carefully implemented:

1. **Policy: Intensifying Urban Vegetation for Cooling and Carbon Sequestration**
   - **Climate Threat:** This policy addresses the threat of increased urban temperatures and excess atmospheric carbon.
   - **Option:** The plan proposes the use of "green infrastructure" such as increasing urban vegetation and trees, which "saves residences $21.8 million in cooling costs each year" and helps "store 13 pounds of carbon each year" (CLIMATE ADAPTATION section).
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** While urban vegetation can help mitigate heat and sequester carbon, it may inadvertently lead to maladaptation if water resources are strained by increased irrigation demands, especially in drought-prone areas like Colorado. This could exacerbate water scarcity issues rather than alleviate them.

2. **Policy: Upgrading Infrastructure and Standards to Minimize Vulnerability**
   - **Climate Threat:** This policy targets vulnerabilities in infrastructure to climate change impacts such as extreme weather events.
   - **Option:** The plan suggests "upgrading existing infrastructure and update standards to minimize vulnerability" (CCA1-D CLIMATE PREPAREDNESS PLAN).
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** If the infrastructure upgrades do not consider future climate scenarios accurately, there is a risk that the upgraded infrastructure might not withstand future climate conditions, leading to sunk costs and increased vulnerability.

Given these considerations, it is crucial for the planning jurisdiction to monitor the effectiveness of these strategies carefully and remain flexible to adapt them as new information and technologies become available, to avoid maladaptive outcomes.
