The emphasis is on addressing "historic disparities, as well as those which exist in the present day." (*Equitable and Inclusive Solutions*)

By implementing these policies, the plan aims to ensure that the transition to a low-carbon economy is inclusive and addresses historical and present-day disparities, particularly benefiting those most vulnerable to climate impacts.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the provided document, there is no explicit mention of potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. However, I can infer potential areas of concern based on the strategies and goals outlined:

1. **Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) Promotion**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy addresses the threat of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change.
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** This is a mitigation option, as it involves technologies aimed at capturing and storing carbon emissions to reduce their presence in the atmosphere.
   - **Potential for Inadvertent Maladaptation:** While CCUS can play a role in reducing GHG emissions, reliance on this technology might divert attention and resources from renewable energy development and energy efficiency measures. Additionally, if the technology fails or is not implemented effectively, it could lead to increased emissions in the long term.

2. **Increased Infrastructure for Electric and Low-Emission Vehicles**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The policy addresses emissions from transportation, a significant source of greenhouse gases.
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** This is a mitigation option, focusing on reducing emissions from vehicles by transitioning to electric and low-emission vehicles.
   - **Potential for Inadvertent Maladaptation:** Expanding infrastructure for electric vehicles requires significant energy and resources, which, if sourced from non-renewable energy, could offset the benefits. Additionally, focusing solely on technology-based solutions may overlook broader sustainable transport strategies, such as public transit improvements or urban planning for reduced vehicle dependency.

3. **Nature-Based Solutions for Carbon Storage**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The strategy addresses carbon emissions and urban heat islands by increasing vegetation and green spaces.
   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:** This is both a mitigation and adaptation option, as it enhances carbon sequestration and resilience against heat.
   - **Potential for Inadvertent Maladaptation:** While beneficial, if not carefully planned, such solutions could lead to the introduction of non-native species that threaten local biodiversity. In certain cases, the focus on tree planting could overshadow the need for preserving existing natural ecosystems, which might be more effective in carbon storage and biodiversity conservation.

These potential areas of concern are based on the strategies outlined in the plan and would require careful consideration to avoid maladaptive outcomes.
