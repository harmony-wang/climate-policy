### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
### Resilience
The plan addresses resilience by implementing **Green Infrastructure** practices, which include "the use of vegetation, soils, and other natural elements to manage stormwater" (City of Hartford Energy Action Plan, Green Infrastructure). This approach helps mitigate storm flow and reduce the urban heat island effect, thereby improving the livability and resilience of neighborhoods.

### Mitigation
The plan is primarily focused on mitigation efforts aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It sets specific targets, such as the goal to "reduce energy consumption in its buildings by 20% and purchasing at least 20% of the electricity consumed by municipal facilities from clean, renewable energy sources by 2018" (City of Hartford Energy Action Plan, Our Goal). It includes energy conservation measures, renewable energy projects, and participation in the Clean Energy Communities Program to achieve these objectives.

### Adaptation
While the plan's primary focus is on mitigation, some aspects, such as green infrastructure and energy efficiency improvements, also support adaptation by reducing vulnerabilities to climate impacts like stormwater flooding and excessive heat.

### Classification
The plan can be classified as a **mitigation primary climate action plan**. It emphasizes reducing energy consumption and increasing the use of renewable energy sources as part of a broader effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with some elements that indirectly support adaptation and resilience.

### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
The plan does not explicitly describe a specific scenario of climate change that the planning jurisdiction will face. Instead, it focuses on setting and achieving energy-related goals without detailing potential climate change scenarios. The plan outlines current energy profiles, ongoing initiatives, and strategies for energy conservation and the use of renewable energy to promote sustainability and cost-effectiveness.

### Question: What adaptation options does the plan identify? For each identified adaptation option, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Information provided in the plan regarding cost, timeframe, location, and other important attributes.
**Answer:**
The City of Hartford Energy Action Plan primarily focuses on energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives and does not explicitly identify specific adaptation options relating to climate change. However, the plan does mention initiatives that indirectly contribute to adaptation by enhancing energy resilience and sustainability. Below are some initiatives that could be considered as indirect adaptation options:

1. **Green Infrastructure**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** Urban heat island effect and stormwater management.
   - **Attributes:** 
     - Emphasizes the use of trees and vegetation to manage stormwater and reduce urban heat. 
     - The city aims to plant 1,000 trees annually with the help of KNOX Inc. and other partners. 
     - Trees help in reducing energy usage by removing carbon dioxide and providing shade.
     - No specific cost or timeframe is mentioned for this initiative. 

2. **Energy Improvement Districts (EID)**

### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The provided document, the "City of Hartford Energy Action Plan," does not explicitly mention or identify climate policies specifically aimed at advancing climate justice. The focus of the plan appears to be on energy efficiency, renewable energy adoption, and related infrastructure improvements without direct reference to climate justice or addressing specific vulnerabilities of certain populations or areas. As such, there are no climate policies in the plan that are summarized in terms of addressing a specific climate threat or identifying areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
The document does not explicitly identify any climate policies that may lead to potential unforeseen maladaptation. However, I can provide an analysis based on the content provided:

1. **Energy Improvement Districts (EIDs)**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The EIDs aim to address energy reliability and flexibility, reducing dependence on the conventional utility grid.
   - **Resilience/Mitigation/Adaptation Option:** They propose the use of localized power generation and management outside the normal utility grid. This includes promoting energy efficiency by utilizing heat produced in power generation for nearby heating and cooling needs.
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** While EIDs could increase energy independence and efficiency, there may be potential unintended consequences if the localized systems are not well-integrated with the broader grid. This could lead to increased costs or inefficiencies if the demand forecasts or long-term contracts do not align with actual energy needs or if the systems increase emissions or waste in unforeseen ways.

2. **Microgrid Pilot Program**
   - **Climate Threat Addressed:** The microgrid is designed to provide energy reliability and resilience during long-term power outages.
   - **Resilience/Mitigation/Adaptation Option:** The program involves generating electricity and hot water independently of the main grid, providing backup power to critical community infrastructure.
   - **Potential Maladaptation:** If the microgrid infrastructure relies on non-renewable or inefficient technologies, it might inadvertently increase emissions or operational costs. Additionally, reliance on microgrids could potentially detract from investments in broader grid improvements or renewable energy sources, leading to a fragmented approach to energy resilience.

The document highlights proactive strategies, but these examples underscore the importance of continuous evaluation to ensure that well-intentioned policies do not inadvertently lead to increased vulnerabilities.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.
**Answer:**
