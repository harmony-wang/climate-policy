### Question: What climate policies does the plan identify to advance climate justice? For each climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. Areas or populations with the most climate vulnerability to the identified climate hazard.
**Answer:**
The plan does not explicitly mention "climate justice" or directly identify climate policies specifically to advance climate justice. However, it does contain several policies and actions that may indirectly contribute to climate justice by addressing climate threats and vulnerabilities in various ways. Below are relevant policies identified in the plan with their associated climate threats and vulnerable areas/populations:

1. **Improving Air Quality**

   - **Climate Threat:** Air pollution, particularly high levels of ozone.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Residents of East Baton Rouge Parish, with a focus on areas near industrial plants in northern East Baton Rouge Parish, as these are identified as primary sources of ozone emissions. The plan states that "East Baton Rouge Parish does not currently meet the Environmental Protection Agency’s primary or secondary ambient air quality standards for ozone" (Part 1: Environmental Analysis, Air Quality).

2. **Floodplain Concerns**

   - **Climate Threat:** Flooding, including flash-flooding, headwater flooding, backwater flooding, and coastal flooding.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Almost half of East Baton Rouge Parish lies within the FEMA-designated base floodplains (100-year floodplain) of several rivers and bayous, indicating significant risk for residents in these areas. The plan acknowledges the devastating impact of the August 2016 flood, which was described as a "1,000-year storm" that overwhelmed the drainage system (Part 1: Environmental Analysis, Floodplain Concerns).

3. **Watershed and Wetland Protection**

   - **Climate Threat:** Degradation of watersheds and loss of wetlands, impacting water quality and flood mitigation.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Areas with critical undeveloped land at confluences of major tributaries and critical wetland areas are highlighted for protection and restoration. The plan emphasizes the importance of these areas for flood storage capacity and water quality, which affects the overall environmental health of the Parish (Part 2: Goals, Objectives and Actions, Goal 2).

4. **Tree Canopy Preservation**

   - **Climate Threat:** Loss of tree canopy due to urban development, which can exacerbate urban heat effects and reduce air quality.
   - **Vulnerable Areas/Populations:** Urban areas that may be more prone to heat island effects and poorer air quality due to reduced tree canopy coverage. The plan indicates that preserving and restoring the tree canopy is essential for maintaining ecological balance and mitigating urban heat (Part 1: Environmental Analysis, Tree Canopy).

While these policies focus on environmental protection and resilience, the plan does not provide detailed analysis or mention specific vulnerable populations in the context of climate justice.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the content provided in the plan, the following potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies have been identified:

1. **Policy: Wetland Mitigation Outside the Affected Watershed**

   - **Climate Threat it is Addressing:**
     - The loss and degradation of wetlands due to urban development and other anthropogenic activities. This is a concern as wetlands are crucial for maintaining hydrology and water quality.
     - *"Wetlands continue to be developed in the Parish, significantly modifying the hydrology."* (Part 1: Environmental Analysis)

   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option Proposed:**
     - The policy involves wetland mitigation, which allows for the purchase of replacement wetlands often outside of the watershed or even the state.
     - *"Often property owners mitigate wetland loss by purchasing replacement wetlands where land is less expensive, often outside of the watershed or even outside of the state."* (Part 1: Environmental Analysis)

   - **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
     - This approach may lead to the degradation of local hydrology as the mitigation does not occur within the same watershed, thus failing to address the ecological and hydrological functions lost in the original location. Over time, this practice results in the degradation of hydrology within East Baton Rouge Parish.
     - *"Over time, this practice results in significant degradation of the hydrology within East Baton Rouge Parish."* (Part 1: Environmental Analysis)

2. **Policy: Channelization of Waterways**

   - **Climate Threat it is Addressing:**
     - The need to manage increased stormwater runoff and prevent localized flooding.
     - *"Historically, the focus of storm drainage planning and design throughout the U.S. has been to move stormwater as quickly as possible away from where it falls and into pipes and channels."* (Part 1: Environmental Analysis)

   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option Proposed:**
     - Channelizing and lining urban streams and canals with concrete to accommodate increased runoff volumes and velocities.
     - *"Many of the urban streams and canals have been made straighter, deeper, and concrete lined to accommodate increased runoff volumes and velocities."* (Part 1: Environmental Analysis)

   - **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
     - This practice may exacerbate flooding issues by increasing the speed and volume of water flow, potentially leading to downstream flooding. Additionally, it disconnects communities from natural water bodies and negates potential ecological benefits.
     - *"The engineered modification did not alleviate the problem and the community continues to experience substantial flooding."* (Part 1: Environmental Analysis)

By focusing on these maladaptive aspects, the planning jurisdiction can consider alternative strategies that enhance resilience without causing adverse effects.

### Question: In what ways does the plan measure the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option? List any specific metrics used, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, improvements in air quality, or other quantifiable impacts. Identify the exact units (e.g., tons, percentages, index values) mentioned in the plan for tracking these outcomes. Additionally, outline any concrete goals or targets set for each option, including deadlines or specific numerical objectives.
**Answer:**
The plan outlines several objectives and actions related to environment and conservation, but it does not specify detailed metrics or units for measuring the success or failure of each adaptation, resilience, and mitigation option. Instead, it provides a general framework and strategies for improvement in various environmental aspects. Here are some relevant details from the plan:

- **Air Quality Improvement**: The plan aims to "improve air quality to meet or exceed national ambient air quality standards" (*Part 2: Goals, Objectives and Actions, Environment and Conservation Goal 5*). It mentions actions to reduce emissions from mobile and stationary sources but does not specify exact metrics or units for measurement.

- **Water Quality and Watersheds**: The plan includes objectives to reduce pollutant discharges to meet federal, state, and local standards and improve water quality (*Part 2: Goals, Objectives, and Actions, Environment and Conservation Goal 3*). However, it does not provide specific metrics or numerical targets for these improvements.

- **Tree Canopy Preservation**: The plan seeks to "preserve and restore the tree canopy" and includes actions like setting targets for increasing the urban tree canopy (*Part 2: Goals, Objectives, and Actions, Environment and Conservation Goal 4*). Nevertheless, it does not mention specific numerical targets or deadlines.

- **Wetland Protection**: The plan recommends conducting a detailed analysis of existing wetlands and protecting high-value wetland areas from development (*Part 1: Environmental Analysis*). It suggests actions like requiring wetland mitigation within the same watershed but does not specify exact metrics or goals.

Overall, while the plan outlines various environmental goals and actions, it lacks detailed metrics, units, or deadlines for measuring the success or failure of the specific adaptation, resilience, and mitigation options mentioned.
