### Question: Does the plan describe a scenario of climate change the planning jurisdiction will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? If so, please summarize any such scenario.
**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes a scenario of climate change that the planning jurisdiction, New Orleans, will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation.

**Summary of the Climate Change Scenario:**

- **Current Reality and Challenges:** "For New Orleans, climate change is not a future scenario, but a current reality. South Louisiana is already facing many challenges caused or worsened by climate change due to our unique geography." (Climate Risks and Hazards)

- **Sea Level Rise and Weather Events:** "Sea level rise and a projected increase in the intensity of weather events are expected to accelerate coastal land loss—increasing storm surge exposure while adding greater stresses to our levee and flood protection systems." (Climate Risks and Hazards)

- **Storm Intensity and Flooding:** "Climate change is projected to cause greater intensity in storm events, including hurricanes and severe storms, that can cause flood and wind damage." (Climate Risks and Hazards)

- **Infrastructure and Utility Interdependencies:** "The interdependencies of the City’s utilities mean that effects can spread across multiple systems. Waterlogged soils, in conjunction with high winds, often result in downed trees and power lines, leading to outages that compromise the City’s energy-dependent stormwater and wastewater pumping facilities and significantly increase the period of power interruption." (Climate Risks and Hazards)

- **Heat and Health Impacts:** "More extreme heat episodes will directly threaten the health of our residents and the reliability of infrastructure systems that supply us with energy and water. The record heat we have experienced over the past few years causes higher concentrations of air pollutants and greater amounts of ozone in our urban areas and accelerates the spread of allergens." (Background)

- **Social Vulnerability:** "A study from Climate Central further showed that some areas of the city act as 'heat islands', sometimes up to eight degrees hotter than other areas of the city due to a lack of green space and shade. These areas of sparse green space are generally our socially vulnerable neighborhoods." (Background)

- **Vector-borne Diseases and Weather Variability:** "A sustained warmer climate also increases the risk of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus. Additionally, we have experienced increased cold snaps and volatility in winter weather in the last few years, putting more stress on our aging infrastructure." (Background)

This scenario outlines the multiple and interconnected challenges New Orleans faces due to climate change, and it provides a context for the city's climate policies related to resilience, mitigation, and adaptation.

### Question: Identify any potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies. For each identified climate policy, summarize: 1. The climate threat it is addressing. 2. The resilience, mitigation, or adaptation option that the climate policy proposes. 3. Why it may cause inadvertent maladaption.
**Answer:**
Based on the content provided in the document, here are potential unforeseen maladaptive climate policies:

1. **Policy: Increased Recycling Rates through Infrastructure and Education**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:**
     - This policy addresses the threat of greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste management. The plan states, "Waste management may provide a major opportunity for New Orleans to create value and economic activity that is currently not being captured" (Waste Management Section).

   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:**
     - Mitigation: The policy proposes increasing recycling rates to a "25% diversion rate by 2030" (Waste Strategies Actions).

   - **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
     - While increasing recycling can reduce waste-related emissions, if not implemented properly, it might inadvertently lead to maladaptation by increasing reliance on recycling infrastructure without addressing the root causes of waste production. This could lead to increased costs and resource use for recycling processes without significantly reducing overall waste generation or carbon footprint, especially if recycling education and infrastructure do not keep pace with population growth or waste generation trends.

2. **Policy: Divest City's Investments in Fossil Fuels and Invest in Clean Energy and Climate Solutions**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:**
     - This policy addresses the threat of climate change induced by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, highlighting a commitment "to divest from fossil fuels and invest in a sustainable future" (Ramp Up the Local Climate Action Economy Section).

   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:**
     - Mitigation: The policy involves investing in clean energy solutions as a measure to reduce emissions.

   - **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
     - If the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy is not managed carefully, there can be economic disruptions, particularly in job markets dependent on fossil fuel industries. Additionally, rapid shifts without adequate infrastructure for clean energy may lead to energy shortages or reliance on interim solutions that are not sustainable, thus potentially increasing vulnerability to energy supply disruptions. 

3. **Policy: Build Additional Green Infrastructure**

   - **Climate Threat Addressed:**
     - This policy addresses climate threats such as flooding, storm surges, and other water-related hazards by enhancing stormwater management through green infrastructure (Adaptation & Nature-Based Solutions Section).

   - **Resilience, Mitigation, or Adaptation Option:**
     - Adaptation: The policy involves implementing green infrastructure, such as rain barrels and permeable surfaces, to manage stormwater naturally.

   - **Why it May Cause Inadvertent Maladaptation:**
     - While green infrastructure can effectively manage stormwater, if not designed or maintained properly, it may lead to unintended consequences such as localized flooding if the capacity is exceeded. Additionally, without adequate community engagement or consideration of local conditions, these systems might not perform optimally, leading to increased vulnerability of certain areas or populations to flood risks.
