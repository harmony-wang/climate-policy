### Question: To what extent does the plan address resilience, mitigation, and adaptation? After providing a brief summary of how it addresses each component, classify the plan as a whole as one of the following: mitigation dedicated, adaptation/resilience dedicated, mitigation only climate action plan, mitigation primary climate action plan, equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan, or sustainable/green plan.
**Answer:**
**Resilience:**

- The plan emphasizes resilience through initiatives like the "Beat the Heat Hunting Park" which addresses heat vulnerability in neighborhoods. It focuses on community engagement and developing neighborhood heat plans. The plan also mentions the establishment of the City’s first Environmental Justice Advisory Commission to tackle environmental harm disparities. Additionally, it aims to create a "Citywide Climate Resiliency Strategy" and update the "Office of Emergency Management's Hazard Mitigation Plan" (PHILADELPHIA CLIMATE ACTION PLAYBOOKGREENWORKS PHILADELPHIA 37).

**Mitigation:**

- The plan outlines actions to reduce carbon pollution, such as working towards a "100% clean electricity grid" and advocating for clean energy policies. It also explores renewable energy projects and citywide composting to divert organic waste (PHILADELPHIA CLIMATE ACTION PLAYBOOKGREENWORKS PHILADELPHIA 18, 33).

**Adaptation:**

- Adaptation is addressed through actions like creating a citywide adaptation roadmap and implementing recommendations from the PDPH Climate Change and Health Plan to prepare for public health risks due to climate change. The plan also mentions investment in green landcover to manage flooding and extreme heat (PHILADELPHIA CLIMATE ACTION PLAYBOOKGREENWORKS PHILADELPHIA 35, 37).

**Classification:**

The plan can be classified as an **equal mitigation and adaptation climate action plan** as it addresses both mitigation by reducing GHG emissions and adaptation by preparing for climate impacts through various strategies.

**Answer:**
Yes, the plan describes a scenario of climate change that Philadelphia will face and for which it is planning climate policies for resilience, mitigation, and adaptation. 

**Scenario Description:**

- Philadelphia is expected to experience "hotter, wetter weather due to climate change" (Adapting to a Changing Climate).
- The city anticipates an increase in "hotter temperatures and more precipitation" (Environmental Impacts).
- By 2100, the number of days above 95°F could increase from an average of four days annually in the 1900s to up to 52 days (Environmental Impacts).
- There will be "more rain in the warmer months, and increased snowfall during winter" leading to deeper and more extensive flooding, particularly along the Schuylkill and Delaware Rivers (Environmental Impacts).
- The city will face more powerful storms, akin to Hurricanes Sandy and Irene, which pose a significant financial burden and health risk (Environmental Impacts).
- Economic impacts include the potential costs of $200,000 - $2,000,000 for recovery from severe weather events, and an estimated $20,000,000 due to climate-change induced health impacts by 2050. Additionally, annual air conditioning costs could rise by $1,000,000 (Economic Impacts).

These scenarios necessitate the planning of climate policies focused on resilience, mitigation, and adaptation to address the projected changes and associated risks.
