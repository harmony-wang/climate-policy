      "The plan identifies several actions aimed at climate adaptation and resilience, but there is a potential risk of maladaptation associated with the development of an Urban Heat Vulnerability Index and Mitigation Plan (Action 2.32). While the intention behind this action is to prepare for higher temperatures and more frequent extreme heat events, there are considerations that could lead to maladaptive outcomes if not carefully managed.\n",

      "For instance, if the Urban Heat Vulnerability Index prioritizes certain neighborhoods for interventions without considering the socio-economic dynamics or existing environmental conditions, it could unintentionally exacerbate inequalities. Communities that are already vulnerable may not receive adequate resources or attention, leading to a situation where interventions fail to improve overall resilience and may even worsen the living conditions for the most at-risk populations.\n",

      "Similarly, the implementation of neighborhood cooling strategies (Action 2.33) without community engagement could result in solutions that do not fit the local context or needs, potentially leading to ineffective or even harmful outcomes.
